      <h1>Case Summary: Mayhem Dive in a Strong Current Leads To Near Drowning and Multiple Injuries</h1>
      <h3>A diver encountered several incidents in one dive — including buddy   separation, strong currents, faulty equipment, out-of-gas situation and   lacerations —that resulted in him nearly drowning.</h3>
      <h2>Reported Story      </h2>
      <p>I began this dive around 3:30 p.m. The water condition started to get   choppy. We were told at the dive briefing that we were headed into the   current and that we were to go around the pinnacle of the reef to view   giant mantas.<br />
        <br />
        The dive started out fine with a descent to 109 fsw   (33 msw). As the currents picked up — we had to hold onto the wall of   the reef with one hand — we ascended to 53 fsw (16 msw). By this time I   was holding on with two hands. I was maybe 40 fsw (12 msw) or so from   the pinnacle when I suddenly looked around and saw that all the divers   and the four divemasters were gone. I felt like I couldn't move forward,   and I couldn't let go.<br />
        <br />
      At this point I had 1000 psi (68 bar) of   air remaining. I started to panic for a couple minutes; then I got my   act together and decided to climb vertically. I knew from the briefing   that there was a huge surge at 23 fsw (7 msw) at the face of the reef   and we were supposed to stay away from there, but I was starting to   panic and hyperventilate.</p>
	   <p align="center"><img src="_images/case_current.jpg" width="180" height="300" border="0" /></a></p>
	   <p>When I hit the face of the reef, I tried to wedge myself  into a few cracks so I could get my composure. I was trying to release my  safety tube to let someone know where I was surfacing. At that point, a couple  things happened. I had already been cut up pretty badly between the climb and  banging against the reef, then the surge caught me and flipped me. I broke my  right ulna and sustained some significant lacerations to my arms and legs.<br />
           <br />
	     Then I took a breath and realized I had run out of air. I figured I had been at  20 fsw (6 msw) for long enough, so I surfaced. I was so panicked by then that I  was overloaded with CO2. I could not inflate my vest or my safety buoy or use  my whistle. I screamed a few times to get the attention of the boat about 68m away. I did not think to drop my weights or my vest. The swells were 4 to  5 feet by now, and I was exhausted and hyperventilating.<br />
  <br />
	     I don't remember what happened next. I believe I went under, and one of the  divemasters jumped off the ship and swam out to me. He pulled me up and held me  until the zodiac came. When they stripped me to get me into the zodiac, I lost  my camera and GoPro. They pulled me into the zodiac and put me face down onto  the oxygen tanks, which forced water from my lungs. I was blue but  hyperventilating. I don't remember any of the zodiac ride, but my dive buddy  said when I got to the ship I was still very blue; they moved me to the steps  onboard, administered oxygen and stripped off my dive suit.<br />
  <br />
	     I had about six lacerations that needed suturing, all coral cuts. I am a  doctor, so later I opted not to close them. I had plenty of Cipro on board, so  I started taking antibiotics. I also had about 20 minutes of pure oxygen. I  ended up with a headache, but I felt lucky to be alive. </p>
	   <p>My dive gear was stripped away, so I was not allowed to see  my dive computer or my air tank. Later I noticed there was no dive valve on the  vest I had been using. I had trouble most of the day with having to surface  early; I wonder if I had been missing my valve all day, which would account for  my running out of air on this dive, too. My vest was damaged in transport, so I  had borrowed this one from the ship. I take full responsibility for not  checking my gear properly.<br />
           <br />
	     I should have died at several times during this incident, but it just wasn't my  day to do so. The water was full of sharks. When I was at 20 fsw (6 msw), there  were at least 10 reef sharks hanging in the current. Not one shark approached  me even though I was bleeding. I continued to dive the next day at the strong  advice of the captain. I ended up going on 17 out of 25 dives for the nine-day  trip.</p>
	   <h1>Follow-Up Comments from the Diver</h1>
	   <ul>
	     <li>My buddies never said why they left me. They made  it past the pinnacle but then abandoned the dive and were carried off by the  current and surfaced quite a distance away. I think some others just let go and  surfaced with air in their BCs for a controlled ascent but were still carried  far away.</li>
         <li>The conditions on subsequent dives were mild to  moderate. We didn't encounter strong currents again. We dived for six days  total, and the accident was on the first day. I really felt from the dive  briefing that we should not have approached the dive on the side of the severe  current and that it was too late in the day for such an aggressive dive. I also  feel the diving company was rather cavalier in their thought of &quot;let's all  just jump in the water and see you when you are done.&quot; No buddy system was  discussed. After the accident the captain dived with me the entire next day  (which is almost unheard of), and then I requested and/or stayed with a dive instructor  for the rest of the trip.</li>
         <li>The company that ran the liveaboard took the dive  computer and filled the air tank immediately after the incident. I had rented  both pieces of equipment from them. I was unable to see either item before they  took them back; it took me quite a while before I could think clearly.</li>
         <li>That evening when I was able to think more clearly,  I went to inspect my gear. That is when I found that they had refilled my tank  with air to 3000 psi and replaced my dive watch. I was the one who found that  there was no valve on the back of the vest. While I was inspecting the  equipment, I also noticed that one set of weights was gone from the vest. I  immediately went to show the captain, who said it must have been ripped off in  the accident. I tried to explain how much trouble I had with the two previous  dives in regards to air loss, buoyancy, etc., but he said he didn't agree. He  also indicated that I probably didn't run out of air, that I just panicked and  had a CO2 overload and maybe I was just using the wrong buttons to inflate my  BC. I can't prove it, but I remember at 53 feet (16m) looking at my gauge and seeing  that I only had 1000 psi. I am not an air &quot;sucker&quot;; I always surface  with at least 700 to 900 psi. If I had air, I should have been able to inflate  my safety buoy and my vest.</li>
         <li>Regarding the ulna, I continued to dive with it. It  was so swollen that I didn't realise for two days that I had a big hematoma.  The fracture was just a hairline, so I splinted it when I got home. </li>
      </ul>
	   <h2 align="left">Comments</h2>
	   <p align="left">Diving in a current is always a hazardous activity and requires proper   risk evaluation, adequate planning and safety measures. The predive   check should be thorough and rigorous. In this case, I would prefer to   hear comments from readers.<a href="mailto:communications@danap.org"> Please write us with your comments</a>, or just   think about what you would have done in a similar situation.<br />

	   <h1>Have You Experienced a Diving Incident?</h1>
	   <p>As part of DAN AP's Non-Fatal Dive Incident Reporting Project (NFDIR)  we are keen to receive information on various problems including     non-fatal  drowning, DCI, equipment problems, oxygen toxicity, boat     encounters, marine  animal injuries, and many others. Please let us know     when you are involved in,  or observe, a potentially dangerous diving     incident. Information from such incidents can  provide a wealth of   important insights about dive   accidents and greatly  assist in   determining good preventative   measures. <em>Note: The incident does not need to have resulted in injury. </em></p>
