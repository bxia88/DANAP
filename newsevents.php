        <h2>Alert Diver: Sept - Dec 2013 Issue</h2>
        <p align="justify">The Sept - Dec 2013 issue of Alert Diver Magazine is in the process of being posted to Members. You should receive your copy within the coming weeks. This issue includes a review of DCI and fatality statistics from 2012, a rapid ascent diving incident, a celebration of John Lippmann as he steps down as DAN AP's Executive Director, and much more. <em>Note: Alert Diver is a Member-Only benefit. </em></p>

        <h2>World Map of 2012 Compressed Gas Diving Fatalities</h2>
        <p align="justify">The figures indicated  on the map are the minimum number of fatalities in the countries shown. These  are taken from reports provided to IDAN organisations (Asia-Pacific, America,  Europe, Southern Africa, Japan) and also include some taken from various media  sources.</p>
        <p align="justify">The number for  certain countries will be relatively accurate (eg. U.S.A., Australia, New  Zealand, U.K., Japan.) However, the numbers for many other countries,  especially less developed countries, are very likely understated.</p>
        <p align="justify">The data from  Europe (with the exception on the UK) is predominantly taken from insurance  claims so is also very likely to be an underestimate.</p>

        <h2>DAN's Jellyfish Investigation : Can You Help?       </h2>
           <p align="justify">There  has been an increase in reported serious jellyfish stings in Thailand, and  possibly elsewhere in Asia. Since mentioning our jellyfish investigation we  have received several great photos of jellyfish, some being dangerous species  found in Thailand and the Philippines. DAN AP encourages any underwater  photographers in Asia, especially Thailand,&nbsp;to photograph any jellyfish  they see on a dive and send a copy of the photo to us. <em>Please be sure to  document as precisely as possible the locations of each photo. </em>Your  assistance will enable us to increase our understanding, to better catalogue  the potentially dangerous species present in parts of our region and help in  establishing appropriate prevention and management strategies. </p>
        <p>We have  produced a large poster with images of some potentially deadly jellyfish and  useful first aid and prevention advice. We have already begun to distribute  these in Thailand and plan to make them available elsewhere in the Region. </p>
