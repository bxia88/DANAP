      <h1> Remember to Breathe </h1>
		      <p align="justify"><em><strong>Diver Question: </strong></em></p>
	               
              <p><em>In basic open-water classes, divers   are told &quot;never to hold their breath&quot; for fear of lung injuries due to   the expansion of compressed gas during ascent. Further, students are   told that the most dangerous part of the ascent is closest to the   surface.  Why is this? What is the actual mechanism by which lungs are   injured by expanding gas? Do they actually rip and tear? Since the lungs   are surrounded by a fluid-filled sac, where does the expansion occur?   Is there empty space between the lungs, the sac, and the rest of the   body? Finally, why exactly would the last bit of the ascent be more   dangerous, say, than covering the same vertical distance much deeper?   Doesn't the ambient pressure change as much between 18m and 9m as it   does between 9m and the surface.</em></p>
              <h6><strong>DAN Answer </strong></h6>
              <p>Lung expansion injuries can be   the most dramatic and life-threatening emergencies in scuba diving. They   are generally a result of lung overinflation due to pathological air   trapping (lung disease), or breathholding during ascent. A good   understanding of lung anatomy is essential to comprehending the   associated risks. The main bronchi divide into smaller airways called   bronchioles and continue to branch and reduce in size until they form   the respiratory bronchioles, which terminate in the alveolar sacs. The   alveoli are the key functional unit of the respiratory system where gas   exchange takes place. These fragile air sacs are surrounded by a   delicate membrane only one- to two-cell layers thick and are encompassed   by a network of tiny blood capillaries. Exposed to atmospheric   pressures at sea level, our lungs are in a state of equilibrium as we   inhale and exhale. Slight pressure changes occur as we change elevation,   yet equalization of the pressures inside and outside the lung is a   passive and inconspicuous event with each breath. During descent into   water, all gas-containing spaces in the body tend to shrink as the   pressure surrounding the body increases; for example the lung volume of a   breathhold diver becomes smaller with the descent in the water column.   Because scuba regulators deliver breathing gas at the ambient pressure   of the diver, higher concentrations of the breathing gas enter the   lungs, preventing the reduction in volume that would occur. Otherwise,   the lungs will progressively increase in volume until the elastic limit   of the alveoli is exceeded and lung injury occurs. This forces gas into   one of three locations:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>the space  within the chest cavity (pleural space), a condition known as pneumothorax;</li>
                <li> the tissue  planes within the lung itself (interstitial space), from where it may travel  into the space around the heart, the tissues of the neck and the larynx  (mediastinal emphysema); or</li>
                <li>the blood.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>                In this latter condition (arterial gas embolism, or AGE), gas bubbles can pass  from the pulmonary capillaries via the pulmonary veins to the left side of the  heart, and then to the carotid or basilar arteries (cerebral arterial gas  embolism, or CAGE). While this explanation appears reasonable, it is not  completely satisfactory. Since lung tissue is extremely compliant, one would  expect the interstitium of the lung and the vessels within it to be subjected  to the same increase in pressure as the alveoli. The vessels might therefore be  expected to collapse, preventing gas from entering. Probably gas enters blood  vessels at &quot;corners&quot; of the lung - for example, between the lung and  the mediastinum, where pressure differentials may cause disruption (tearing),  allowing extra alveolar gas to enter. It is important to note that a breathhold  ascent from a depth as shallow as four feet of sea water(fsw)/1.2 meters (msw)  may be sufficient to tear alveoli sacs, causing lung tear and one of these  three ailments. For a fixed quantity of gas, the relationship between its  volume and the external pressure is provided by Boyle's law. In essence,  British physicist/chemist Robert Boyle discovered that at a constant  temperature and mass, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the  pressure exerted on that gas. When the pressure is doubled, the volume is  reduced to one-half of the original volume. Conversely, when the pressure is  reduced by one-half, the volume doubles. For a diver at 15 fsw/4.6 msw, the  total pressure acting on his body is 1.5 atmospheres (one atmosphere at the  surface, plus an additional 0.5 atmospheres exerted by the water column). A  sudden ascent to the surface would therefore result in a 30 percent pressure  reduction, and assuming a compliant chest wall, a volume increase of 50  percent. Lung injury may result. Actual volume changes may be less than this  because of the effect of the surrounding chest wall to provide some rigidity  and protection for the lung. However, if the same vertical change occurred from  a depth of 66 fsw/20 msw, the 0.5 atmosphere of depth change would only result  in a 16 percent reduction in pressure and a 20 percent increase in lung volume,  and would be less likely to cause lung injury. Boyle's law thus explains why  abrupt changes in depth while in shallow water can be far more hazardous than  equivalent changes of depth in deep water.<br />
