          <h1>2006 Diving Fatalities  </h1>
          <h2>          Scuba Diving Fatalities (Australia) </h2>
          <h6>SC 06/1</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This victim was a 52-year-old male with a  medical history of hypertension, although he was not taking any medication for  this. He was an experienced diver who had been 
            scuba diving since his early twenties, but  rarely over recent years.</p>
          <p align="justify">He had decided to clean the hull of his  boat which was moored in a sheltered inlet and a friend remained on board to  assist with various ropes. He was wearing a wetsuit but no 
            weight belt, however, he placed four  weights (a total of 9.8kg) in his BCD pocket. The depth was 3 msw and  visibility less than one metre.</p>
          <p align="justify">After a short time underwater, he  surfaced, re-submerged and soon resurfaced about 5 metres from the boat, this  time without his mask and with the regulator out of his mouth. He called for  help and his friend threw him a rope but the victim had already re-submerged.  The friend entered the water and tried to find him but couldn&rsquo;t see him in the  muddy water. His body was found several hours later. His mask and snorkel were  nearby and one fin was missing.</p>
          <p align="justify">The equipment was tested and found to be  in poor condition. The cylinder was nearly full, indicating the victim had  taken few breaths from it after entering the water. The&nbsp; weights in the BCD&rsquo;s pockets were  unditchable in an emergency, and he was excessively weighted. The lost fin was  recovered and its buckle strap noted to be 
            undone, while the other was capable of  easily dislodging. The fins were described as too floppy to provide effective  thrust. The low pressure corrugated hose had snapped off the 
            BCD but it is unknown if this occurred  while the victim was alive or during the retrieval of his body. <br />
  <em>Cause of  death: </em>Drowning.</p>
          <h6>SC 06/2</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This very experienced 72-year-old male had  conducted over 1,000 dives in 30 years and continued to dive regularly. He was  obese and had a past history of night-time seizures but no record of recent  seizures.</p>
          <p align="justify">He made a boat dive to a maximum depth of  17 msw with a group of regular dive buddies. After about 30 minutes, they had  ascended to a depth of 9.5 msw where there was a passage under a large boulder.  There was a strong surge through this archway and then upwards. Several divers,  including the victim, decided to allow the surge to take them through it. He  was last seen alive as he entered the arch.</p>
          <p align="justify">A witness on another boat reported seeing  the victim surface and look around as if to get his bearings and showed no  signs of distress. When the victim failed to rejoin his friends, 
            they began a search for him and soon found  some of his weights and then one fin. When they could not locate him they  notified the police.</p>
          <p align="justify">About an hour later, his backpack and  cylinder were found floating and his body was then seen floating about 50  metres further away. CPR was unsuccessful.              <em>Cause of  death: </em>Drowning  (cause unknown).</p>
          <h6>SC 06/3</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 35-year-old male had done rescue  diver training four years earlier and logged 18 dives during the previous year,  although it is unknown how much overall diving experience he had. He was in  good health and appeared to be very fit.</p>
          <p align="justify">He was undertaking a commercial diving  training course in a fresh water quarry with very low visibility and a muddy  bottom. The victim and another student were performing a task at a depth of  about 12 m. He was wearing a full-face mask, suit, harness and lifeline 
            with voice communications. He (and his  buddy) had a 2500 l cylinder with a pony bottle attached upside down as a  reserve supply. The victim&rsquo;s reserve was configured so that 
            his primary air supply could be almost  exhausted prior to accessing his reserve, although the buddy could access his  earlier.</p>
          <p align="justify">Their cylinders were about half-full when  they set out on a task but this was not&nbsp;  completed as the buddy needed to activate his reserve and the supervisor  told them both to return. During the return, there was an urgent call for help  and the sound of water entering the victim&rsquo;s mask. The instructor dived in  equipped with a mask and a knife but was unable to locate the victim.  Eventually, another diver located the victim, who was not wearing his mask, and  managed to lift him to the surface after some initial resistance from the  attached and entangled lines. CPR was commenced and continued until the  ambulance arrived and took over, but he died shortly afterwards.</p>
          <p align="justify">            An equipment check showed that the primary  tank was empty but the pony bottle was almost full and turned off. It was  difficult to reach and open the valve of the reserve, particularly if it had  been firmly turned off.            <em>Cause ofdeath: </em>Drowning.</p>
          <h6>SC 06/4</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 64-year-old male overseas tourist was  on a liveaboard dive boat on the GBR. He had completed more than 100 dives  since certifying 20 years earlier, but he had dived infrequently, if at all,  during the previous three years. He declared that he had no medical conditions  and was described as &ldquo;looking fit&rdquo;, reportedly doing vigorous 
            exercise for 1&frac12; hours daily. However, he  was obese and his luggage was later found to 
            contain several medications, including  some for high blood pressure and asthma.</p>
          <p align="justify">This was the first dive of the trip and  there was a group of four: the instructor, two inexperienced divers, and the  victim. There was a 0.3-metre swell and a slight current. After reaching a  maximum depth of 12 msw, the victim signalled to his buddy to turn back and  they slowly ascended to 5 msw where the victim knelt down and grasped 
            the coral for a couple of minutes. He  appeared to be mildly confused or distressed and possibly also clutched at his  chest before inflating his BCD and rapidly ascending to the 
            surface. The buddy followed shortly  afterwards, found him to be unconscious and alerted the dive boat.</p>
          <p align="justify">A tender was quickly sent but the crew  were unable to drag the victim on board immediately as he was too heavy. After  another few minutes, and with additional&nbsp;  assistance, he was successfully brought onto the tender where rescue  breathing was 
            commenced. On the main vessel, CPR with  supplemental oxygen was begun and continued until a paramedic arrived and took  over. However, resuscitation attempts were<br />
          unsuccessful.  <em>Cause of death: C</em>erebral arterial gas embolism - CAGE  (Possibly precipitated by a cardiac problem).</p>
          <h6>SC 06/5</h6>
          <p align="justify">            The victim was a 40-year-old apparently  healthy male who was the skipper of a crayfishing boat. He had certified as a  recreational diver almost three decades earlier but his subsequent diving  experience is unknown.</p>
          <p align="justify">He dived to retrieve his boat&rsquo;s anchor,  which had been lost at sea several days earlier at a depth of approximately 12  msw. He hired scuba equipment at a local dive store and set out to the site  with a crew member to assist. The conditions were calm. A shot-line was dropped  where he believed the anchor to be and before entering the water, he shackled a  rope to his BCD, hoping to attach it to the anchor and use it to drag the 
            anchor up when back on the boat. He  appeared very anxious.</p>
          <p align="justify">The crew member stayed on the boat to  manoeuvre it as required. After what he estimated was 10-20 minutes, the crew  member noticed that the victim had surfaced and 
            appeared to be in trouble. He drove the boat  to the victim who appeared to be unconscious and had partly submerged by then.  He managed to hook the victim&rsquo;s BCD with a gaff and dragged him to the side of  the boat, although he was unable to bring him fully on board. He then dragged  the victim to the rear of the boat and eventually, 
            with the use of a winch, managed to lift  him onto the transom where he attempted CPR without success.<em>Cause of death: </em>Drowning.          </p>
