      <h1>Maintaining Fitness on a Liveaboard</h1>
      <p><em>By Jessica Adams, Ph.D., and Stephanie Deltufo, B.S.</em></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../_images/Liveaboard_Fitness1.jpg" width="560" height="373" /></p>
<p align="justify">In a previous <em>Alert Diver</em> article, we described fitness as a transient phenomenon.   That means the choices you make every minute of every day matter — even   the choices you make while on your dream dive vacation. Unfortunately,   there is no &quot;vacation mode&quot; for your metabolism, and no one can take   your body running for you while you lounge on the deck between dives.   When you put your training on hold, fitness decline is a slow but sure   process. Don't let your dream vacation be the start of your fitness   demise. A liveaboard dive vacation poses particular challenges to   mitigating the effects of detraining.<br />
  <br />
  The exercises described   here take into account you are on a dive vacation. If you choose to add   exercise beyond diving and stretching, incorporate them as far from your   dives as possible. Make sure the intensity is very low as well — not   more than 50 percent of your maximal effort. Intense exercise is NOT   recommended in the hours preceding or following your dive.<br />
  <br />
  To get   the most out of the space and time you have, shift your focus from   traditional exercise routines to simply being healthy. Keep the &quot;fidget   factor&quot; in mind: Every movement counts. Make smart choices each minute;   it's not just about what you do during workouts but the accumulation of   movements every minute of every day. The goals are low-intensity toning   and fitness maintenance.</p>
		      <h2 align="justify">Hydrate and Fuel Up</h2>
		      <p align="justify">When spending a lot of time diving and in the sun, be sure to drink   plenty of water. Sports drinks and sodas contain many empty calories,   which have little or no nutritional value and will make you feel tired   faster. Juices have nutritional value but can increase your caloric   intake very quickly, so be selective. Making sensible food choices will   provide you with more energy for diving. The human body frequently   confuses thirst and fatigue with hunger, causing you to crave excess   sugars. In general, a good indication of sufficient hydration is clear   or light-colored, odorless urine.</p>
		      <h2 align="justify">Activities for Small Spaces</h2>
		      <p align="justify">Try to improve your posture and stretch a lot — it feels really good.   Take the opportunity to try any yoga moves you might know. It's so easy   to get caught up in the daily grind of waking to the alarm and trying to   get out the door on time that we often fail to stretch in the morning.   But this is your vacation; take a moment to do so in your bunk (or on   the floor or deck).</p>
		      <h2 align="justify">Posture</h2>
		      <p align="justify">Most people know maintaining good posture is important for wellness.   However, few of us practice it on a daily basis. A dive vacation is a   good time to increase your overall kinesthetic awareness (knowledge of   where your body is in space) and begin to make good posture a habit.   Start by taking a moment to consider your current posture. Next, align   your back by bringing your shoulders up toward your ears and then   dropping them down and back. Then briefly contract (tighten) your   abdominal muscles. Try to consciously do this each time you sit down to   discuss and log your dives, eat, have a cup of coffee or read a book.   After about 1,000 repetitions (which accumulate faster than you think),   this practice should become natural.</p>
		      <h2 align="justify">Basic Stretching</h2>
		      <p align="center"><br />
	          <img src="../_images/Liveaboard_Fitness2.jpg" width="560" height="373" /></p>
		      <p align="justify">Lie on your back and reach way up over your head while pointing your   toes, and hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Then roll over onto your stomach,   press your hands onto the floor beneath your shoulders, and push your   shoulders up while keeping your hips in contact with the ground. You   should feel a stretch along the front of your body and through your   midsection. Breathe deeply, and take a moment to focus on your body   without considering what you may look like; stretch whatever area feels   tight. One of the greatest barriers to fitness is concern over how we   look or where it is appropriate to exercise. It is always appropriate to   care for your body.</p>
		      <h2 align="justify"><a href="https://www.onlineexambuilder.com/cardiovascular-health/exam-38346"></a>Intermediate Stretching: Upward Dog</h2>
		      <h6 align="center"><img src="../_images/Liveaboard_Fitness3.jpg" width="560" height="402" /></h6>
		      <p align="left">One of our favorite yoga poses is upward dog. Lie on the floor on your   stomach with the tops of your feet on the floor. Place your hands, palms   down, directly under your shoulders, and press until your arms are   straight (don't lock your elbows). Your torso will lift off the ground   as you straighten your arms. Rotate your shoulders back so they are   pulled away from your chest. Breathe, trying to fill your lungs to the   top; it should feel good. For a deeper stretch, lift your legs off the   floor so only your hands and the tops of your toes are touching.</p>
		      <h2 align="left">Downward Dog</h2>
		      <p align="center"><br />
		        <img src="../_images/Liveaboard_Fitness4.jpg" width="560" height="373" /></p>
		      <p align="left">To transition from upward dog to downward dog, start by shifting your   body back into a kneeling position, and then elevate your torso so your   hips are directly above your knees. Place your palms face down in front   of you. Tuck your toes under, and press into your feet until your butt   is in the air. It's OK if your knees are bent due to tight hamstrings —   they'll loosen if you do this frequently. Be sure to adjust often as   this is a big stretch. When you feel comfortable, slowly drop a knee   while pressing into the opposite heel, and then switch. This will slowly   stretch out your calves.</p>
		      <h2 align="left">Lunges</h2>
		      <p align="left">Hold on to a stable surface at your side, step one foot backward as far   as you comfortably can, and lower your body straight toward the ground.   Hold this position for as long as you can comfortably hold it; you will   feel a stretch in your groin and tension in your thigh muscles.<br />
		        <br />
		        Contrary   to the popular Las Vegas adage, what happens on your dive vacation does   not stay on your dive vacation. Healthy choices are key to maintaining   fitness. It's not a crime to indulge — you are on vacation. However,   it's imperative that a single indulgence does not transform into   throwing in the towel. Maintaining a consistent level of fitness will   not only improve your dives during your trip but will also allow you to   step back into your exercise routine after returning home, well rested   and as fit as when you left.		      </p>

	              <strong>DAN Note</strong></em><strong>:</strong> To avoid an increased risk of decompression sickness, DAN® recommends   that divers avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours after making a dive.   During your annual physical exam or following any changes in your health   status, consult your physician to ensure you have medical clearance to   dive.</p>
