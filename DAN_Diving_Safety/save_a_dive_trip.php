          <h1>Tips to Save a Dive Trip</h1>
	      <p align="justify"><em>Ironically most medical problems experienced  by divers during a dive trip are not related to diving at all. They are more likely  to be the result of an accident, a prior medical condition or from eating contaminate  food. Divers can anticipate issues around previously known medical conditions and  contaminated food. For any Unexpected issues pre trip planning a good  medical kit and proper Immunisations can make a big difference.</em></p>
	      <p align="justify">Plan for potential medical mishaps when you  make travel plans, as medical resources vary widely around the world. In  general, medical care in remote locations can be difficult to find and is  variable in quality. Divers Alert Network (DAN) has 24-hour telephone access  for medical emergencies, but some basic preparation may eliminate the need to make  such a phone call.</p>
	      <h2>Pre-Existing Conditions</h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        lf you take any medications regularly or sporadically,  bring enough for your entire trip, plus extra amounts in case the trip is  extended unexpectedly. Keep them packed in the original pharmacy bottles in  your carry-on. lf your luggage gets lost, you would still have your medication.  In case you need more medication at your destination, or there are questions at 
	        customs, consider bringing a written prescription  from your physician.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Carry a list of your regular medications and  your medical conditions. This will aid your fellow travellers in getting you help  in the case of an emergency.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Wearing a medical alert tag for an allergy or  specific condition is also important. lf possible, have a list of the medical resources  available at your destination.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Confirm with your health insurance company  that you are covered when you travel outside of your home country for medical  incidents. lf you are not covered, consider purchasing general travel  insurance.</p>
	      <p>Many other countries accept only cash payment  for medical care &ndash; before treatment. Be prepared if you need to use the local  health care system. You may have to be reimbursed for the cost of your  treatment when you get home. DAN TravelAssist will help facilitate 
	        medical care and may help defray the costs  of treatment away from home, depending upon your membership insurance level.</p>
	      <h2>Cuts, Scrapes and Stings</h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Most of the injuries on a dive trip are cuts  and scrapes to the skin that happen both above and below water. In both cases,  clean the wound well with drinking water and watch for signs of infections, such  as redness, pain, swelling and warmth. To address such small 
	        injuries, maintain and use a medical kit.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Coral scrapes become infected easily, and  applying antibiotic ointment may help prevent an infection. lf the skin around  a wound becomes red, tender and warm, a more extensive infection may be brewing  and possibly require oral antibiotics. Several antibiotics can treat skin  infections. Discuss them with your physician to choose the best option for you.</p>
	      <p align="justify">People tend to share medication with fellow  travellers. Be careful here. Many people have allergies to medications, and  taking the wrong antibiotic may cause a serious allergic reaction.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Allergies can develop anytime. I have seen  people develop hives and difficulty breathing within a few minute of taking an  antibiotic that they have taken in the past without a problem. ln a remote  area, this would be life-threatening.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Sea urchin spine injuries are among the most  common marine-related injuries. They occur more often on night dives when some  species are more active. On one night dive in Dominica, three different divers  came out of the water with urchin spines in their knees and legs that happened  because their attention was diverted by an octopus. That evening we had an  urchin spine removal clinic.</p>
	      <p align="justify">I removed as many spines as possible, cleaned  the puncture sites and then applied hydrocortisone around the affected areas to  help with the inflammation from the pieces that remained. Even so, it took  several weeks for the itching and irritation to resolve.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Fine-tipped tweezers may help with removal  of the spine. However, in the case of the long-spined diadema urchins, there  isn't much you can do to remove the spines; they are too fine 
	        and brittle. Analgaesics such as acetaminophen  or ibuprofen can help with the pain.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Some items that are good for wound care are  gauze pads, bandage tape and adhesive bandages. A liquid bandage product can  help with small open wounds and blisters. There are also products that help  stop bleeding. Use hydrocortisone ointment to treat some 
	        rashes, but don't use it on open wounds.</p>
	      <p align="justify">An air-activated heat wrap is quite handy to  help treat a pulled muscle. An elastic bandage can be used for a sprain or to  stabilise an injured limb.</p>
	      <h2>Swimmers&rsquo; Ear</h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Otitis externa, or swimmers&rsquo; ear is an  infection of the outer ear canal. It occurs more often when there is aggressive  cleaning of the ear canal with a cotton swab that removes the protective wax (cerumen)  and with prolonged exposure to water. Cerumen is an important 
	        defense against OE; it repels water,  prevents bacterial growth and protects against infection by making the ear canal  more acidic.</p>
	      <p align="justify">To prevent this infection, rinse the outer ear  with a few drops of a 1:1 mixture of vinegar and isopropyl alcohol. This helps  dry the ear and inhibits bacterial growth by lowering the pH. An earache that  worsens when gently pulling the outer ear suggests that there may be 
	        an infection of the ear canal. In this case,  keep the ear dry, use antibiotic eardrops and take pain medication if needed.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Otitis externa is one of the most common  problems I see on dive trips. More people have lost a day or two of diving from  this condition than almost anything else. As a precaution, at the end of a day  of diving I organise ear drop rounds, where I make sure everyone in our group  uses the vinegar/ alcohol drops and avoids this painful problem.</p>
