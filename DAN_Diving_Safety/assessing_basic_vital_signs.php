      <h1> Assessing Basic Vital Signs </h1>
		      <p>Assessing vital signs (&quot;vitals&quot;) is a key component of good first   aid. It consists of taking a series of simple measurements that provide   data about a body's functioning. These measurements can help reveal how   sick or hurt a patient is and, when taken over time, whether he is   getting better or worse. While the full meaning of these measurements   might elude the lay provider, a carefully documented series of vitals   can be very helpful to the health-care professionals who will eventually   take over the care of an injured person. </p>
              <p>Vital signs can be helpful even to first aid providers with   limited medical training. Sets of vitals that are outside normal ranges   typically indicate the need for some treatment or possible evacuation to   a higher level of care. As an example: Anxiety, elevated heart rate,   elevated respiratory rate and pale, cool, clammy skin may indicate   shock, a potentially life-threatening medical condition. Shock is   relatively easy to address, but it can go unnoticed if vitals aren't   monitored. Vital signs that move increasingly further from their normal   range over time may indicate an even more urgent need for evacuation.</p>
              <h6><strong>Time</strong></h6>
              <p>To organise and keep track of your measurements, it is very important   to document the time of day along with each set of vital signs. This   allows you (or a subsequent caregiver) to make comparisons between sets   of vitals and observe trends in the patient's condition. The frequency   with which vitals are taken depends on the patient's condition.   Seriously injured or ill patients should have their vital signs   reassessed every few minutes, while hourly checks are reasonable for   those who are stable.</p>
              <h6><strong><strong>Level of Responsiveness</strong></strong></h6>
              <p>An injured person's mental status, or level of responsiveness, is   probably the most important vital sign. Since the brain has top priority   in the body's distribution of resources, a decline in its status is   especially important to recognise. To assess a patient's level of   responsiveness, begin talking to the person. If the person is able to   respond to you, ask the following questions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>What is your name? </li>
                <li>Where are we? </li>
                <li>What time is it (approximately)? </li>
                <li>What happened? </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Answers to these four questions allow you to gauge a patient's   orientation to person, place, time and event. If the patient can answer   all four appropriately, he would be considered &quot;Alert and Oriented to   Person, Place, Time and Event&quot; or, more commonly, A+Ox4 (read &quot;A and O   by four&quot;). In addition to quantifying the patient's level of   responsiveness, it's also helpful to write down a qualifying term.   Helpful qualifiers include &quot;irritable,&quot; &quot;anxious&quot; or &quot;combative.&quot; Words   like these help round out your description of the patient's mental   status. </p>
              <p>In the event that an injured person is awake and can respond to   you but does not know the answers to any of these questions, that person   can be considered alert but disoriented. </p>
              <p>A common scale used to describe a person's mental status is the   AVPU scale. AVPU is an acronym that stands for alert, verbal, painful   and unresponsive. The paragraph above describes patients who have an A   rating on this scale, but sometimes ill or injured people are not alert.   If the person does not respond when you attempt to engage him in   conversation, talk louder. In a loud voice, ask if he is OK. </p>
              <p>If he responds to this elevation in volume, he can be considered   responsive to verbal stimulation or V on the AVPU scale. The person   doesn't have to respond verbally to be considered V; he may simply   grimace or open his eyes, but any response to sound means he is a V. If   the person does not respond to your verbal stimulus, you should assess   his responsiveness to pain. It is important not to cause harm, but   simply elicit a response. A good way to do this is to pinch the   patient's tricep, just above the elbow. If this causes the patient to   respond, by moving or groaning, for example, the patient is a P on the   AVPU scale. Finally, a patient who does not respond to verbal or painful   stimulation is considered unresponsive, or U, on the AVPU scale.</p>
              <h6>Pulse</h6>
              <p>A strong heartbeat is required to ensure an adequate supply   of oxygenated blood to the body's tissues. To assess the pulse in an   unconscious person (V, P or U on the AVPU scale), use the carotid artery   in the neck. Place two of your fingers gently on the patient's trachea   and slide them laterally. Do not reach across the trachea (use the near   side), and do not try to assess on both sides of the neck at once. </p>
              <p>You should feel the pulse in the carotid artery right next   to the trachea. In a conscious patient (A on the AVPU scale), it is   best to find the radial pulse on the wrist; this is less invasive. </p>
              <p>Checking the radial pulse is less invasive when the   patient is concious.  To find the radial pulse, place two of your fingers where the base of   the patient's thumb meets his wrist. The pulse will most likely be   between that spot and the most prominent tendons of the wrist. </p>
              <p>If you are having difficulty finding the heart rate, you   may be pressing too hard or not pressing hard enough. Once you locate   the pulse, count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number   by four, and you'll have the patient's heart rate in beats per minute. </p>
              <p>In addition to the rate, it's important to document the   rhythm and quality of the pulse. The rhythm will be either regular or   irregular, and the quality will usually be described as strong or weak.   Most healthy adults have a resting heart rate of between 60 and 100   beats per minute, regular and strong. People experience a natural   elevation in their heart rate when performing exercise or in stressful   situations. The heart beats faster to ensure sufficient oxygenation of   tissues, allowing the body to respond quickly in emergencies. A person's   pulse may be elevated shortly after an emergency, but this should   stabilise in people who are not seriously injured.</p>
              <h6>Respiration</h6>
              <p>                Since the body can survive for only a few minutes without   oxygen, it's important to check the function of the respiratory system.   If a person knows you are trying to count his respirations, he will   probably change his rate of breathing and skew your measurement. To get   around this, transition smoothly to counting respirations as soon as you   are finished checking the pulse. Once you have counted the heart rate,   shift your focus to the breathing. Leave your fingers on his wrist, but   watch for his chest to rise. If you're unable to detect respirations by   watching the chest, it might be helpful to watch the abdomen or the   shoulders instead. Folds of the patient's clothing might also aid your   observation of respirations.</p>
                          <p>Since respirations are less frequent than   heartbeats, count respirations for 30 seconds, then double the number to   achieve an accurate result. As with pulse, measuring the rhythm and   quality of respirations is important. Rhythm will be either regular or   irregular. Words like &quot;unlaboured,&quot; &quot;gasping,&quot; &quot;wheezing&quot; or &quot;laboured&quot;   are used to describe the quality of respirations. An adult at rest   typically breathes between 12 and 18 times per minute, regular and   unlaboured.</p>
                          <h6>Skin</h6>
                          <p>Skin is the body's largest organ, and it can be an   excellent window into the body's functioning. If the skin is pale, cool   and clammy, this is a sign that the body's resources (i.e., blood) are   being diverted to more vital organs. When assessing the skin, you should   take note of three different characteristics: colour, temperature and   moisture. </p>
                          <p>Skin colour, of course, varies widely among   individuals, but there are non-pigmented areas of the body where all   humans are pink. The most accessible of these places is the inside of   the bottom lip. Take a look and note whether the color is indeed pink or   some other color. It might be pale if the person is cold, blue if he is   hypoxic, red if he is hot or even yellow if he is suffering from some   illness. Temperature and moisture of the skin are best assessed on the   abdomen. These are generally more consistent there than on the hands or   the face. The abdomen should be warm and dry, so if it's cool, cold, hot   or moist, that is especially important to document. </p>
                          <p>Level of responsiveness, pulse, respirations   and skin condition are by no means the only vital signs, but they are   important and relatively easy to assess. The only equipment necessary to   measure these is a watch, a pen and paper. Other vital signs include   blood pressure, lung sounds, pupils and body temperature. Though   training, experience or equipment may limit your ability to care for an   injured buddy in a remote environment, assessing basic vitals is   something just about anybody can do to help.<br />
