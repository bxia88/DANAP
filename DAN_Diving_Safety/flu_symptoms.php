      <h1> Flu-like Symptoms Following a Dive </h1>
		      <p align="justify"><em><strong>Diver Question: </strong></em></p>
	               
              <p><em>Over the past three years I have developed a condition related to   diving: within two to four hours of my last dive on the first day of   diving, I usually develop flu-like symptoms, including malaise, chills   and fever. 
              Although I don't experience other symptoms such as   headache, trouble breathing or neurological symptoms, I do get a vague   sense of irritation in my lungs and sometimes a dry cough. By the next   day I am usually better. I have had a normal chest X-ray, EKG and blood   chemistries, but no diagnosis has been made. Can you help?</em></p>
              <h6><strong>DAN Answer </strong></h6>
              <p>This malady has several possible explanations. Compressed gas breathing   may result in pulmonary barotrauma; saltwater aspiration, directly or   through a poorly functioning regulator, may also cause these symptoms.   Mild decompression illness (DCI) can cause fatigue, but usually not   chills and fever. This could be a condition that existed prior to the   dive and coincidentally manifested itself afterwards (flu, perhaps). It   is possible that breathing air under pressure may spread microorganisms   from the breathing apparatus into the lungs. This was described in   &quot;Proceedings of the Eighth Symposium on Underwater Physiology,&quot; A.J.   Bachrach and M.M. Matzen, editors, Undersea Medical Society, Bethesda,    pp. 113-180.</p>
              <p>                This condition could possibly be prevented by   routine regulator maintenance and cleaning. DAN's records show   similarities in calls concerning these otherwise unexplainable symptoms;   and although this information is anecdotal, it deserves investigation.   Unfortunately, most callers did not seek a medical evaluation while they   were symptomatic, and reported symptoms after they had resolved. In   each case the diver experienced flu-like symptoms within hours of the   dive. This was always immediately after the first dive day or first   dives in a series. Symptoms all resolved within 48 hours, many times   within 24 hours.The limited calls to DAN do not indicate that this is a   widespread problem, but DAN needs more information on this malady and   its relationship to diving. Post-dive symptoms must be carefully   considered; continuing to dive with symptoms could cause additional   problems. DAN always recommends that you be examined by a physician or   other healthcare professional. The possibility of decompression sickness   must always be included in a differential diagnosis when a medical   complaint is raised following a dive.<br />
