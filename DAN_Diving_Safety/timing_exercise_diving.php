      <h1> Timing Exercise and Diving </h1>
		      <p align="justify"><em><strong>Diver Question: </strong></em></p>
	               
              <p><em>I regularly exercise and want to continue my routine on my vacation.   I am worried about diving and exercise. Is there any information that   can help me plan for both?</em></p>
              <h6><strong>DAN Answer </strong></h6>
              <p><strong>Timing of Exercise and Diving</strong> <br />
                <br />
                After accepting the need for regular exercise to maintain   physical fitness, the next issue concerns the timing of exercise   training and diving. Scheduling outside physical fitness activities can   be problematic when an active diving schedule is maintained. While part   of this is simply a time management problem, there are other   considerations. Conducting intense physical exercise too close to diving   activity can be problematic for more fundamental reasons. <br />
                <br />
                Bubble formation, while noted earlier as not equivalent to or a   guarantee of DCS, can indicate an increased risk for it. Intense   physical activity -- generally with substantial muscular forces and   joint loading (the application of forces on joints) -- is believed to   transiently increase micronuclei activity, the presumed agent of bubble   formation. Intense physical activity too close to diving may therefore   be problematic. Physical activity after diving may also stimulate   additional bubble formation, possibly through a combination of increased   micronuclei activity and increased joint forces. Interestingly, some   preliminary work has shown that an intense bout of exercise conducted 24   hours prior to diving may reduce bubble presence in humans <em>(Ref 3)</em>, possibly   by inhibiting micronuclei activity. This potentially protective effect   was not seen with exercise conducted closer to dive time. While this   effect needs to be validated, the preliminary findings may support a   simple rule of thumb for scheduling exercise. To reduce the risk, it is a   good idea to avoid intense exercise 24 hours before and after diving. <br />
                <br />
                The near-dive window will be best for low-intensity activities.   Those who participate in cross-training activities may find it easiest   to accommodate this schedule. For those who are more single-minded,   diving may fit well into training rest days for those who put the   priority on exercise, while training may fit best into diving rest days   for those who put the priority on diving. Overall, lower training   intensities will likely be more appropriate for the latter group, but   accommodations can be reached. <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Timing of Exercise During Diving</strong> <br />
                <br />
                Physical activity during the dive also has a direct impact on   decompression safety<em> (Ref 4,5,6,9)</em>. Exercise during the compression and bottom   phase increases inert gas uptake, effectively increasing the subsequent   decompression obligation of any exposure. It is important to remember   that dive tables and computers estimate inert gas uptake, they never   know reality. On the flip side, light exercise during the decompression   phase (including safety or decompression stops) increases inert gas   elimination and reduces risk. The caveat on exercise during   decompression is that more is not always better. Too much or too intense   exercise during the decompression phase can stimulate bubble formation,   thus inhibiting inert gas elimination and increasing decompression   risk. <br />
                <br />
                We do not yet have sufficient data to quantify the difference   between beneficial and potentially harmful exercise. Understanding the   various issues and applying common sense confers the best protection.   Most important is that moderate time-depth profiles are your best   defense. Exercise considerations provide only a secondary defense. In   terms of the secondary defense, though, the compression and bottom   phases are best associated with the lightest exercise possible. Ascent   and stop phases are best associated with mild, low-intensity exercise.   Exercise that is aggressive and/or stimulates substantial joint-loading   is almost always undesirable at any point near or during a dive. <br />
                <br />
                Finally, the post-dive period is a good time to take a nap or   relax over lunch. Both decompression and mental health can be helped by   an extended period of relaxation between the end of the dive and the   start of equipment shifting and/or racing on to the next activity. <br />
                <br />
                In summary, physical fitness - including both strength and   aerobic capacity - is important for divers both for physical safety and   decompression safety. Regular exercise training is best scheduled to   separate intense exercise and diving. Intense physical training should   be 24 hours on either side of diving activity. Any exercise within 24   hours of diving should involve the lowest possible joint forces. <br />
