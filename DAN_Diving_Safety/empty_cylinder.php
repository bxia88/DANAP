      <h1><strong>The Boat’s Emergency Oxygen  Cylinder Was Empty!</strong></h1>
      <p><em>Whether you’re on a liveaboard  or dive boat the availability of oxygen equipment and someone trained in the  effective provision of oxygen is critical. </em><br />
      <em>As many readers will know, DAN  Asia-Pacific has launched an Oxygen Awareness and Preparedness Campaign in an  effort to encourage more dive operators to be prepared to help a diver needing  oxygen first aid. Additionally, divers are also being encouraged to be  proactive by choosing to dive with operators that are prepared to help them  should they need it. </em></p>
      <h2><strong>Case 1: Liveaboard, Malaysia: Operator Unprepared</strong></h2>
              <p>It was during a surface interval on the second day of diving that the  diver’s symptoms commenced with chest pain that felt to the diver like  muscle strain. Upon laying down the diver felt nauseous, the chest pain intensified,  and severe itching of the chest and stomach began. Red welts appeared and  spread covering most of the torso. Advice was sought from the divemaster who  thought it was an allergic reaction. The diver, having consumed a seafood  lunch, considered this a possibility.</p>
              <p>                Over the coming hours the rash  became dark red and very painful (with touch and body movement), although the  itching had subsided. Advice was then sought from the captain (also a  divemaster). The diver suggested breathing O2 but the captain was positive it was an allergic  reaction. Although doubtful, the diver allowed herself to be persuaded to ‘wait  and see’. By the next day the rash had improved but there was still some pain.  The diver’s husband spoke to the captain and suggested that although it might  not be a bend, oxygen was ‘worth a try’. The captain agreed<strong>. </strong>It was then discovered that the boat’s “emergency” oxygen  cylinder was empty so some was decanted from their Nitrox supply. Fortunately,  the diver’s symptoms subsided and by the next morning the rash had all but  disappeared. </p>
              <h6><strong><em>DAN Comment</em></strong></h6>
              <p><em>The divemaster and  captain should have readily provided oxygen, rather than the diver and her  husband having to ask. Being a liveaboard it is of even greater importance to  be oxygen first aid prepared as often the distance to proper treatment is  substantial. The diver was fortunate in that she had ceased diving - continuing  is likely to have intensified her symptoms thereby worsening her condition.</em></p>
              <p>It  is inappropriate and unwise for a divemaster or captain to withhold oxygen  because they don’t think a diver is suffering from DCI. Although dive  professionals are taught about the recognition and first aid for DCI and other  diving accidents, this is relatively basic and most have little or no further  and/or extensive diving medical knowledge or experience. For this reason, most  dive professionals (and other divers) should never put themselves in the  position of trying to diagnose any medical problem, such as possible DCI. <strong> </strong></p>
              <h2><strong>Case 2: Malapascua, Philippines - Emergency Plan in Place</strong></h2>
      <p>Not wanting to miss  the chance to see the Thresher Sharks again, it was the third early morning  start for the diver, who was feeling tired. On the way back to shore she  started to feel a minor tingling&nbsp;in her knees.&nbsp;Knowing something was  wrong she immediately asked for oxygen. Fortunately the boat was equipped and  she started breathing O2 straight away and continued doing so until  the boat arrived at shore (approx 25 mins), at which point the dive shop  manager checked the diver’s symptoms and immediately called&nbsp;the DAN DES  hotline.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>                The diver was  advised to breathe near-100% O2 for a few hours, for which the  operator was adequately prepared, rest and see if the symptoms decreased. The  diver’s condition&nbsp;did not improve so she was required to travel by boat  and car to reach a Chamber in Cebu. Fortunately, the Operator was very prepared  and the diver was able to breathe O2 the entire way, nearly 4-hours,  whilst being accompanied by a staff member from the dive centre. 
                The diver underwent  one recompression treatment, which she responded well to, and made a full  recovery. </p>
              <h6><strong><em>DAN Comment</em></strong></h6>
              <p><em>This diver was fortunate the operator she  chose to dive with was so well prepared and she was able to breathe </em>O2<em> (although the concentration is unknown) from the very first onset of  symptoms to arrival at the Chamber. She still required treatment and one  wonders what her condition might have been had the operator been unprepared –  she might have been considerably worse and may have required multiple  treatments and/or been left with residual symptoms.  </em></p>
      <h1><strong>Is Your Dive Operator  Prepared?</strong></h1>
              <p>                Oxygen should be available wherever diving is conducted.  Even if a dive site may be only 15-20 minutes from shore, what may seem to be a  short delay can sometimes affect the extent of recovery, or in some instances,  the chance of survival, especially in the event of a cerebral arterial gas  embolism (i.e. bubbles in blood vessels supplying the brain).  
      Before you book your next dive trip or liveaboard, make sure you ask  the operator the following questions, so you know you will be looked after in  an emergency:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Is O2  available on all the dive boats?</li>
                <li>Can  the operator’s equipment provide high-concentration O2 to a breathing and non-breathing diver?</li>
                <li>How  many hours O2 supply  do they have? Is it enough to get to appropriate medical care?</li>
                <li>Is  their staff trained in O2  First Aid?</li>
                <li>Do they have an Emergency Plan?<br />
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Let’s work together to improve oxygen first aid preparedness  in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
