      <h1><strong>Diver’s air consumption appeared unbelievably good!</strong></h1>

	      <h4 align="justify"><strong>Buddies share air on ascent when one of them mistakenly thought he was  running out of air. </strong><br />
      </h4>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>REPORTED STORY</strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        The day  started out as usual for a diving day; my buddy and I assembled our gear and  everything went as normal. I dive with double 12 litre tanks with a  back plate. We used drysuits since this is cold water diving and we planned the  first dive to a wreck at a maximum depth of 30 msw (98 fsw). Since my air  supply is almost double that of my buddy, I tend not to check too often. I  check my submersible pressure gauge (SPG) just once in a while as I know my  buddy will run out of air much sooner than I would anyway. When I eventually  checked my SPG it had just moved slightly (about 20-30 bars, ~300-400 psi). I  thought this was very strange, but I knew my air consumption was starting to  become quite good lately. Still, I thought this was way too little air  consumed. At the safety stop, I tapped my SPG just to see if anything happened,  but no, it still showed around 180 bars (~2600 psi) left.<br />
            <br />
	        When we came up, we started discussing this and we both wondered what could  cause this extremely low consumption. We also put on my buddy's regulator and  SPG just to see if the pressure was same, and it was. I thought that maybe  since a guy at my club had filled my tanks, he may have accidentally put 300  bars (4350 psi) in my tanks and that I was a bit sloppy when I read the gauge  before entering the water. I could remember that it was just above the major  marker and I asked myself, was it just above 200 bars or 300 bars (3000 or 4000  psi)? To me this might explain such apparently low consumption.
      <p align="center"><img src="../_images/dual_tanks.jpg" alt="Air" width="350" height="420" /></p>
	      <p align="left">            We completed our surface interval and kitted up again; the pressure in my tank  was 180 bars (2600 psi) and that was more than enough for a second dive. We  planned the second dive to a max depth of 18 msw (59 fsw). An open water diver  asked to join us which was, of course, no problem. The plan was that I would  stay in front as I wanted to do some photography, the new diver would stay in  the middle, and my buddy who is an instructor would stay in the back. The dive  was uneventful for about 25 minutes when suddenly, I felt resistance when I was  breathing.      </p>
	      <p align="left">I asked myself, &quot;What is happening now?&quot; Almost at that same time, I  was suddenly unable to take a breath. Quickly, I turned around to find my buddy  who was just 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) behind me. I gave the out-of-air signal and  he grabbed for his octopus. It felt like forever, but the time from when I gave  the signal to when I got my first breath from his backup could not have been  long. For the first few breaths, it felt like his 1st stage did not deliver  enough air; but when I managed to calm down more, breathing became easier. Even  though I think we both reacted calmly and did not panic, I felt stressed until  I was sure I could get air from my buddy's backup.      </p>
	      <p align="left">We signaled to the third diver that we would start the ascent to the safety  stop. We did that and on the way I was starting to think about my backup around  my neck. I purged it and there was still air coming from that. So at the safety  stop, I switched to my backup and let go my buddy's octopus. We finished the  safety stop and ended the dive.      </p>
	      <p align="left">At the surface, we started talking about what happened. My buddy thought, at  first, that I was just &quot;testing&quot; him because I started using my  backup in the safety stop. But when we started to look at my gear we found out  what was wrong.      </p>
	      <p align="left">The isolator valve on the manifold was closed so I breathed the tank on my  right side till it was empty and the amount of air that was used on my SPG was  just the air I had inflated my drysuit with from the tank on my left side.	        </p>
	      <p align="left">When I thought about it later, all the signs should have been enough to  understand what was happening, but we still overlooked the real issue. Thanks  to our practice of staying close together when we do cold water diving where  the visibility is sometimes very poor, my buddy was not far away this time to  help me out. We have talked about it several times after and we think we  reacted in a good way when the situation became real. It shows that if you keep  calm and don't panic then it is much easier to solve the problem you are  presented with. The open water diver told us when we came up, he thought it was  just a drill and not a real incident. What I have learned though is to always  check everything and don't assume that things are as you left it.</p>
	      <h2 align="left"><strong>COMMENT</strong></h2>
      <p align="justify">No-one expects to run out of gas but sadly, every year a number of divers  panic when it happens unexpectedly even if their buddy is nearby. This diver  signaled his buddy and secured an alternate air source before commencing his  ascent. Later, he realized the cause of his apparent ‘out-of-gas' incident. No  doubt when he opened his isolator valve a fraction then he would have heard the  air moving from his left tank into his right tank until they were at equal  pressure.<br />
        <br />
        This is not an uncommon problem with isolator valves in manifolded doubles and  a common method to prevent this problem is to perform shut-down drills before  descending. Known as S-drills, this is where each diver reaches behind the head  to shut down then fully re-open each valve. In this particular case it appears  the divers did not check all their valves and inflating the drysuit, (plus  possibly cooling of the tanks), caused the pressure in the left tank to fall  slightly during the dives, further masking the problem.<br />
        <br />
        When wearing a set of manifolded doubles, divers might remember this advice: if  your air consumption appears too good to be true, then check your isolator  valve because it probably is.<br />
