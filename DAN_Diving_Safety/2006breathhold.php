          <h1>2006 Diving Fatalities  </h1>
          <h2>          Breath-hold Diving &amp; Snorkelling Deaths (Australia) </h2>
          <h6>BH 06/01</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 44-year-old male was an experienced  snorkeller who was making a documentary film on marine life. He was reportedly  standing on, or floating above some reef in water
            of a depth of about 1.5 metres of seawater  (msw), over a large stingray. A cameraman was in front of the stingray and the  victim behind when the ray turned around and rose and flicked its barbed tail  which hit the victim forcefully to the left of his sternum. He was seen to pull  the barb out but then collapsed. Resuscitation was attempted but was  unsuccessful.<em>Cause of  death: </em>Trauma-related.</p>
          <h6>BH  06/2</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This  55-year-old male overseas visitor went snorkelling with a group off an island  resort on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). No details are available relating to  his health, swimming and snorkelling experience or the water conditions.</p>
          <p align="justify">The  victim was noticed floating motionless by lifesavers and was quickly reached,  found to be unconscious, and brought ashore. He was unresponsive and not  breathing so CPR was commenced while awaiting the arrival of oxygen equipment  and an automated external defibrillator (AED). Resuscitation was ultimately  unsuccessful.<em>Cause of  death: </em>Cardiac-related.</p>
          <h6>BH  06/3</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This  70-year-old male had no history of medical problems and was taking no  medications. He went snorkeling from a commercial vessel on the GBR and it is  unknown whether he had any previous snorkelling experience. </p>
          <p align="justify">He  was using mask and fins and a &lsquo;noodle&rsquo; floatation aid. There was a strong  current running off the reef towards where the boat was anchored and conditions  were described as &ldquo;quite rough&rdquo;. He remained in the designated snorkelling area  between the boat and the reef and a lookout was on duty to watch those in this  area.</p>
          <p align="justify">After his wife reported him missing, he  was eventually found about 300 metres further from the reef, floating  face-down, unconscious, with his mask and fins in place and supported by the  &lsquo;noodle&rsquo;. He was brought back to the boat where CPR was commenced, but was  unsuccessful.<em>Cause of death: </em>Drowning.</p>
          <h6>BH 06/4</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 74-year-old male overseas tourist was  reported to have been active and apparently healthy, although he was being  treated for hypertension. Although he was a competent
            swimmer, his snorkelling experience was  unknown.</p>
          <p align="justify">He was on a commercial day trip to a  pontoon on the GBR. Sea conditions were reported to be rough due to a moderate  wind, with a slight current and a water temperature of 27oC. The victim was wearing mask, snorkel,  fins and a lycra suit, without any additional buoyancy aid.</p>
          <p align="justify">At the time, there were approximately 25  swimmers in the water although the victim was snorkelling alone. Minutes after  the first passengers had entered the water, a lookout saw the victim floating  slightly submerged just outside the buoyed area. When she went to him in the  safety dinghy, she found him unresponsive but with his eyes open. His mask was  in place but full of white froth, and his snorkel was out of his mouth. Unable  to lift him into the dinghy unaided, she returned to the pontoon to get another  lifeguard and they brought him on the boat and took him to the pontoon. 
            CPR was attempted, without success. <em>Cause of death: </em>Cardiac related.</p>
          <h6>BH 06/5</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This victim was a 61-year-old male visitor  from overseas who was touring the GBR on a large cruiser. He had a history of  kidney disease and was on multiple medications, but it is unknown whether the  victim had reported his health status to the cruise operator. He was reported  to have been a competent swimmer but it is unknown whether or not he had  snorkelled before.</p>
          <p align="justify">He was snorkelling from a beach off an  island resort and a safety boat with lookouts was present. The weather was  clear, with a moderate wind and waves less than one metre, 
          but it is unknown whether there was a  significant current where they were. After about 45 minutes he was noticed to  be floating at the surface, face-down, motionless, with the tip of his snorkel  bobbing below the surface. He was unresponsive and his face was blue. One of  the group attempted in-water rescue breathing and, when the tender&nbsp; arrived, he was taken to the boat where CPR  was attempted, without success.<em>Cause of death: </em>Cardiac-related.</p>
          <h6>BH 06/6</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 69-year-old male was an overseas  tourist of unknown prior snorkelling experience who was on a sailing vessel on  the GBR. He appeared to have been healthy and had not reported having any ill  health on the pre-snorkelling questionnaire. </p>
          <p align="justify">The victim and other passengers had been  provided with snorkelling equipment and were swimming or snorkelling between  the vessel and the beach, some 20 metres away. The water depth was about 15  msw, the conditions good, and those in the water were monitored by crew on the  vessel. The alarm was raised when two of the passengers saw a pool of blood  under the water. The safety tender soon found the victim floating and  unresponsive with blood in his mask. He was quickly returned to the vessel  where CPR was attempted without success. <em>Cause of death: </em>Cardiac-related.</p>
          <h6>BH 06/7</h6>
          <p align="justify">            The victim was a 26-year-old male overseas  visitor with no known health conditions. He and his girlfriend hired mask,  snorkel and fins to go snorkelling from a popular, although un-patrolled, beach. Both were weak  swimmers and the victim had not snorkelled before.</p>
          <p align="justify">The water was calm and clear with only a  slight current. The sea-bed angled steeply and the depth reached 2m only 10  metres from shore. They entered the water off a beach and the victim appeared  to be managing well and enjoying it. He chose to remain in the shallow water  when his buddy went further out, into the deeper water. He was later&nbsp; found on the sea bed at a depth of 2 msw and  approximately 10 metres from shore. 
          He was unconscious, not breathing and his  face was blue. CPR was attempted but there was no response. Efforts were hampered  by large amounts of water, froth and bloodstrained sputum coming from his  mouth.            <em>Cause of  death: </em>Drowning.</p>
          <h6 align="justify">            BH 06/8</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 23-year-old male had a history of  epilepsy and did not take his medication regularly. He was an experienced  snorkeller and spearfisherman. </p>
          <p align="justify">On this occasion, he was spearfishing  beside a long pier while his friend motored quietly in a boat nearby. The  victim was observed to be snorkelling alongside the jetty for around an hour  when his friend in the boat noticed that he was motionless. When he came  alongside to investigate, he found the victim to be unconscious. With  difficulty, he 
            pulled him into the boat and found he was  not breathing and he could not feel a pulse. He began CPR and a faint pulse was  felt after the victim vomited some water. A bystander on the pier was alerted  and called an ambulance, which took him to hospital. He died two days later.<em>Cause of death: </em>Drowning (possibly resulting from a  seizure). </p>
          <h6>BH 06/9</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This 76-year-old male was reported to have  been &ldquo;in generally good health but had recently been complaining of &ldquo;tightness  in his chest&rdquo;. It is unknown whether he had 
          consulted a doctor about this. </p>
          <p align="justify">He had first been seen walking up and down  the beach with a metal detector, wearing bathers and a vest and had a mask and  snorkel. Some 15 minutes later, a lifesaver taking part in training activity  saw him floating, apparently unconscious, on the surface off the beach. He was  brought ashore unconscious and not breathing and CPR was commenced. Paramedics  arrived several minutes later and continued resuscitation 
          without success.  <em>Cause of death: </em>Cardiac-related.</p>
          <h6>BH 06/10</h6>
          <p align="justify">            This victim was a 41-year-old male with a  history of alcoholism and unknown snorkelling experience. He and his wife were  snorkelling from a friend&rsquo;s boat off a popular island in 
            temperate waters. The sea conditions were  not reported.</p>
          <p align="justify">He had snorkelled earlier that day without  apparent problems. However, during this second snorkelling excursion, the  victim told his wife that he was &ldquo;not feeling well&rdquo; and swam back to the boat.  He was seen to hold onto its side before his head slumped forward and he  floated away, face-down. He was quickly dragged into the boat and rescue  breathing commenced en-route to the main jetty where the island nurse was 
            waiting. CPR was unsuccessful. <em>Cause of death: </em>Cardiac-related.
