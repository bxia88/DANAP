          <h1>Don't Get Left Behind</h1>
	      <p align="justify">There's probably nothing more shocking than  surfacing from a dive only to realize that the dive boat you came out on is  heading over the horizon back to port - without you. Over recent years,  we've heard of a number of instances in which divers have experienced just such  a situation, sometimes with dire consequences. </p>
	      <p align="justify">Part of being a prepared diver is  acknowledging that such situations can and do occur and being ready to prevent  or cope with them. If you've ever concerned yourself with the prospect of being  &quot;left behind,&quot; read on.</p>
	      <p align="justify">An  old dive buddy of mine used to say that the best way to avoid being left behind  was to tie a nametag to the dive boat's anchor line at the start of the dive.  That way, the crew gets a simple reminder in case they try to pull anchor and  move away before you get back on board. Of course, I don't know what ever  became of that guy.</p>
	      <p align="justify">	        The  more conventional options available to divers for dealing with a &quot;left  behind&quot; scenario range from low-tech whistles and signal mirrors to  high-tech emergency position indicating radio beacons, or EPIRBs. Each one of  these devices has its own strengths and weaknesses, depending on the  circumstances, conditions and the diver's pocketbook. We'll take a look at  these devices and see how they stack up.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>Whistles</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        One of the  simplest devices for getting help from a short distance is a whistle. Many  divers keep a lung-powered whistle attached to the inflator hose of their  buoyancy compensation device for use in emergencies. Lung-powered whistles cost  just a few dollars, are easy to operate (unless perhaps your lips are too cold)  and can be heard for a distance of up to about 800 metres or more in ideal  conditions. This is much farther than the human voice can carry. While whistles  can be good tools for attracting attention, divers should be aware that high  winds, high waves and the operation of a boat's motor can limit the distance at  which the signal will be heard. </p>
	      <h2><strong>Horns</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Compressed-air-powered  horns (such as the Dive Alerttm&nbsp;are more expensive&nbsp; than their lung-powered cousins; they have a  significantly greater range and are easy to use. These devices connect to the  low-pressure hose feeding the BCD auto-inflator and use a small amount of  compressed air to produce a 132-decibel signal that can be easily heard for  distances up to about 1.6 km. </p>
	      <p align="justify">The plus side  of the air-powered horn: It can be operated without removing your regulator  from your mouth, even with cold hands and lips. The downside of using these devices  is that they stop working when you run out of air.</p>
	      <h2><strong>Signal  Mirror</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        A signal  mirror is another low-cost answer to attracting attention. According to Pat  Brown, a former U.S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer and veteran search-and-rescue  team member, about 80 percent of rescues involve the use of signal mirrors.  Under good conditions, a signal mirror can attract the attention of an aircraft  at a distance of around 15 to 30 km, with reports of signals being seen as far  as 160 km away. A signal mirror has no moving parts, no batteries to run down,  doesn't present any potential hazards to the user and can be purchased very  cheaply. </p>
	      <p align="justify">There are two  downsides to signal mirrors. First, using one requires a bit of practice,  although the technique is not very difficult to learn. Second, a signal mirror  works only in sunny daylight conditions. It's of no value in the dark or in  overcast conditions.</p>
	      <h2><strong>Safety  Sausages</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Surface  marker buoys, often called safety sausages, are inflatable devices typically  used to make a diver more visible after a dive from the dive boat. Field tests  have shown that SMBs can be seen from distances of more than 800 metres in good  daylight conditions, or about five times as far as a diver's head can be seen  when it sticks out of the water. <em>(John Lipmann comment: However, this depends on the  surface and light conditions and the size and colour of the sausage.)</em></p>
	      <p align="justify">When it comes  to safety sausages and SMBs, don't let anyone tell you that size doesn't  matter. Both size and colour are important attributes for these devices, and  the bigger it is (both height and diameter), the greater the effect. Udo  Hartig, of Surface Marker Limited in Hong Kong, says his company's WDS Deluxe  Marker (175 cm tall by /15.5 cm in diameter) can be seen at distances of up to  1.6 km), depending on the conditions. Independent studies show that the most  readily detectible colours are a bright, day-glow yellow and international  orange. Quality safety sausages range in price from around US$20 to more than  US$80, depending on the size and additional features.</p>
	      <p align="justify">One unique  twist on the safety sausage is Aqualung's SOS (Surface Observation System),  developed by renowned photographer Steven Frink to meet the needs of one-handed  deployment. Often divers carrying cameras and other equipment have their hands  full, making it difficult to deploy a conventional SMB. The SOS sits in a  holster that replaces the standard lower relief valve of the BCD. When the  diver needs to inflate the SOS, he pulls a cord to release it and then inflates  his BCD using the auto inflator. Excess air inflates the SOS, and a check valve  ensures that the SOS won't deflate, even if the BCD leaks or is partially  deflated. The SOS is compatible with Aqua Lung, SeaQuest and most Technisub  BCDs.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Other surface  marker buoys are available on the market. DAN, for example, has an SMB unit  with a lower pressure inflator that clips to the diver's BCD. Other elements in  the package include a Wind StormR&nbsp;whistle, signal mirror and chemical  lightstick.</p>
	      <h2><strong>Pyrotechnics</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Sending up a  signal flare is a great way to draw attention to your situation. Flares, which  work both night and day, can be detected at distances of up to 10 km. Divers  can now buy signal flares that they can carry underwater and then deploy on the  surface. These have been sold under the name <em>Skyblazer</em>, which has been  sold to Orion Safety Products. </p>
	      <p align="justify">Signal flares  can injure the user, and they also have a limited shelf life. Boaters, for  example, are required by law to replace their emergency visual distress signals  after three boating seasons. While many can last as long as three years, all  flares should be replaced at regular intervals. If you've never used a signal  flare, practice deploying them before you need to use one for real. Remember,  too, that a signal flare, once fired, will last only for a minute or so, so  it's best to send them up only when there's a good chance they will be seen.  (Ed&rsquo;s note: You cannot carry flares on board airplanes when you travel for  diving).</p>
	      <h2><strong>Dive Lights  and Strobes</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        Dive lights  and strobes are much more common items these days in divers' personal gear  bags, and they can be useful in signaling for assistance. Depending on the  particular dive light and the prevailing conditions, it can be seen from a  distance of 800 metres to more than 8 km. Modern dive lights that incorporate  LED technology can typically operate for many hours - some as long as 60 hours.  A good-quality LED dive light will cost anywhere upwards from US$40 or so.</p>
	      <p align="justify">In dark  conditions, emergency marker strobes are also highly effective; they can be  seen from a distance of about 1.6 to 4.8 km. When using a strobe, have it  mounted atop a dive flag or safety sausage so that it can be seen for a greater  distance. A variety of strobes are available for prices upwards of about US$30.</p>
	      <h2><strong>Personal  EPIRB</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        If you're  really serious about not being left behind, around US$600 or so will buy you  some heart-warming electronics that almost (that's right, nothing is for  absolute certain) guarantees that the authorities will come looking for you.  For many years seagoing vessels have carried EPIRBs to signal search-and-rescue  authorities. Now personal versions of these devices, called PLBs (personal  location beacons), are avail-able. </p>
	      <p align="justify">When  activated, these devices transmit a 406-megahertz signal rec-eived by polar-orbiting  and geostationary satellites, triggering an alert with international rescue  authorities. The devices typically incor-porate a 121.5-MHz local homing signal  used by search-and-rescue teams to zero in on the beacon. Most PLBs are not  submersible but could be carried in a submersible case or attached to a surface  float.</p>
	      <p align="justify">One  submersible PLB is the Sea Marshall PLB8-LD SOS Lost Diver Alerting Unit. This  unit uses only the 121.5-MHz local homing beacon. While the 121.5-MHz frequency  has also been monitored by satellite, that satellite ceased monitoring on  February 1, 2009. Still, once a search is under way, the homing signal can be  tracked and located by search-and-rescue authorities or any vessel equipped  with the proper directional receiver. The manually activated PLB8-LD SOS Lost  Diver Alerting Unit has a 100-metre depth rating, a 20- to 30-hour transmitting  time and costs in excess of US$300. </p>
	      <p align="justify">The SPOT  Satellite Messenger combines a GPS and satellite communications capability with  Google Map and Internet services. A user can transmit location and a text  message. The interface with Google Map enables friends, family or EMT personnel  to receive the user's location and movements.</p>
	      <p>While it  isn't waterproof or designed for divers, it might travel nicely in a waterproof  case. </p>
	      <h2><strong>What really  works?</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">	        As you've  probably figured out by now, there is no single perfect signal to draw  attention when you're separated from or left behind by a dive boat. The best  bet is to carry a variety of tools and know how to use them.</p>
	      <p align="justify">A combination  of a safety sausage, whistle or air horn, signal mirror and strobe will  probably round out the most functional and cost-effective arsenal for divers  who want to avoid being left behind. Then again, tying a nametag to the anchor  line might not be such a bad idea, either.</p>
