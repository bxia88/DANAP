      <h1>Exercises to Improve Body and Brain Power</h1>
      <p><em>By Jessica Adams, Ph.D., and Stephanie Deltufo, B.S, Photos by Stephen Frink. </em></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../_images/Exercise_BodyBrain1.jpg" width="560" height="554" /></p>
<p align="justify">Exercise is a powerful tool to optimize brain function and your overall   scuba performance. Scientists used to believe that adult neurons   couldn't regenerate. Little did they know that aerobic exercises such as   the ones described here encourage the development of new neurons. In   fact, even people with dementia, a neurodegenerative disorder, have   shown a 34 percent decrease in cognitive degradation following   cardiovascular exercise three times a week.<br />
  <br />
  Complex aerobic   exercise increases cognitive flexibility and interneuron communication.   This is important for executive brain function, which allows the shift   of attention and the ability to produce creative problem-solving   strategies. Open-water diving takes place in a dynamic environment.   Improved cognitive flexibility may allow divers to recognize more   quickly any changes in their environment and to come up with novel   solutions to adapt to those changes. For a diver, this maximizes dive   efficiency by increasing the connections between memories of learning to   dive, previous dive experiences and muscle memory. This efficiency   allows a diver to respond to a challenging situation more quickly.<br />
  <br />
  The   following complex exercises should be completed in sequence with little   rest in between. Your ultimate goal is to maintain an elevated heart   rate for at least 30 minutes to achieve optimal cognitive and physical   benefits. Start with 10 minutes, and gradually increase the duration as   your exercise tolerance builds. Many of these movements have multiple   steps, so be patient. The sequences are designed to challenge your   coordination, improving visual and motor integration.</p>

  <p><strong>SEQUENCE:</strong>

  <p><strong>Lateral Squat with Cross (20 repetitions/side) </strong>

<h2 align="justify">Overhead Cross Jacks</h2>
<p align="center"><br />
  <img src="../_images/Exercise_BodyBrain2.jpg" width="598" height="315" /></p>
		      <p align="justify">This is similar to a traditional jumping jack, but arms go up only one   at a time, and when legs come together, they crisscross, alternating   which foot is placed in front of the other. Notice that both the hands   and feet cross the midline of the body while your arms are doing   different movements bilaterally.</p>
		      <p align="justify"><strong>Form:</strong></p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Start with hands at your sides.</li>
		        <li>Jump both feet apart, swinging one arm low behind your buttocks and one arm high above your head.</li>
		        <li>Jump both legs in, crossing one in front of the other. Reverse arm position.</li>
		        <li>Jump both legs out.</li>
		        <li>Continue for 30 seconds. Once you have mastered the movement, see how many repetitions you can complete in 30 seconds.</li>
      </ol>
		      <h2 align="justify"><a href="https://www.onlineexambuilder.com/cardiovascular-health/exam-38346"></a>Lateral Squat with Cross</h2>
		      <h6 align="center"><img src="../_images/Exercise_BodyBrain3.jpg" width="598" height="313" /></h6>
		      <p align="left">Sit back into the squat position, <em>keeping your weight through your heels and eyes toward the sky.</em> Try to get as deep into the squat as you feel comfortable. Your range   of motion will naturally increase with each workout. Make sure you focus   on form. Complete 20 repetitions to each side.</p>
		      <p align="left"><strong>Form:</strong></p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms straight at your sides.</li>
		        <li>Step laterally (to the side) as far as you can, and squat down as low as you can. Don't step or squat beyond what's comfortable.</li>
		        <li>Simultaneously, bring your arm across your chest. If you are squatting to the right, bring your right arm across your chest. </li>
		        <li>Return to starting position, and repeat on the opposite side.</li>
		        </ol>
		      <h2 align="left">Burpee to Side Plank</h2>
		      <p align="center"><br />
		        <img src="../_images/Exercise_BodyBrain4.jpg" width="294" height="602" /></p>
		      <p align="center"><img src="../_images/Exercise_BodyBrain5.jpg" width="596" height="152" /></p>
		      <p align="left">Try to hold each plank position for as long as you can while maintaining   a straight body. Work up to holding each plank pose for 30 seconds.   Complete 10 repetitions to each side.</p>
		      <p align="left"><strong>Form:</strong></p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Start standing with both arms extended above your head.</li>
		        <li>Squat down, placing your hands on the floor.</li>
		        <li>Step or jump your feet back until you are in plank position.</li>
		        <li>Transfer weight onto one hand in side plank position.</li>
		        <li>Transfer weight back to plank.</li>
		        <li>Jump feet in and stand up, raising arms overhead.</li>
		        <li>Repeat on opposite side.</li>
      </ol>

	          <em><strong>DAN Note</strong></em><strong>:</strong> To avoid an increased risk of decompression sickness, DAN® recommends   that divers avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours after making a dive.   During your annual physical exam or following any changes in your health   status, consult your physician to ensure you have medical clearance to   dive.</p>
