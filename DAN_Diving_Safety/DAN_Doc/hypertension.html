				<b>Description of Condition:</b><br/> Hypertension, or high
				blood pressure, is one of the most common medical 
				conditions seen in the diving population - no surprise,
				really, since it is a common medical condition in the 
				general population. Strict criteria for hypertension 
				can vary depending on the reference cited, but normal
				blood pressure is generally accepted to be a systolic
				pressure below 140 and a diastolic pressure below 90 mm Hg,
				depending on age (cited as systolic first and diastolic 
				second. eg. "120 over 80," by your doctor). A thorough 
				medical evaluation should be performed to find a treatable
				cause for hypertension; in most cases, however, none will be found.
				<br/><br/>
				Basically, two different sets of complications face a person 
				with hypertension: short-term and long-term. Short-term 
				complications are generally due to extremely high blood
				pressure; the most significant is the risk of a stroke
				due to rupture of blood vessels in the brain 
				(called a cerebrovascular accident). Long-term detrimental
				effects are more common: they include coronary artery disease,
				kidney disease, congestive heart failure, eye problems and 
				cerebrovascular disease.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Fitness and Diving Issue:</b> <br/>As long as the individual's blood 
				pressure is under control, the main concerns should be the 
				side effects of medication(s) and evidence of end-organ damage. 
				Divers who have demonstrated adequate control of blood pressure
				with no significant decrease in performance in the water due to 
				the side effects of drugs, should be able to dive safely. 
				A recent report in a diving medical journal citing several 
				episodes of acute pulmonary oedema (ie. lungs congested with fluid)
				in individuals with uncontrolled hypertension while they were diving. 
				Regular physical examinations and 
				appropriate screening for the long-term consequences of 
				hypertension such as coronary artery disease are necessary.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Medication used in Treatment: </b><br/>Mild hypertension may be 
				controlled with diet and exercise; however, medication is often necessary.
				Many classes of drugs are used to treat hypertension, 
				with varying side effects. Some individuals must change
				medications after one drug appears to be or becomes ineffective. 
				Others might require more than one drug taken at the same time to keep
				the blood pressure under control. Classes of drugs known as
				beta-blockers often cause a decrease in maximum exercise tolerance 
				and may also have some effect on the airways. This normally poses no 
				problem for the average diver. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors
				are the preferred class of drugs for treating hypertensive divers;
				a persistent cough is a possible side effect. Calcium channel 
				blockers are another choice, but lightheadedness when going from a 
				sitting or supine position to standing may be a significant side effect. 
				Diuretics are also frequently used to treat hypertension. This requires
				careful attention to hydration and electrolyte status.
				Most anti-hypertensive medications are compatible with 
				diving as long as the side effects experienced by the 
				diver are minimal and their performance in the water is not 
				significantly compromised. Any diver with long-standing high blood 
				pressure should be monitored for secondary effects on the heart and kidneys.
