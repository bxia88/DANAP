				<span class='heading'>Cardiac Dysrythmias</span>
				<p class='para'>	
				<b>Description of Condition:</b> <br/>The term "dysrhythmia" means abnormal 
				heartbeat and is used to describe a wide range of conditions ranging from benign, 
				non-pathologic conditions to severe, life-threatening rhythm disturbances. 
				More familiar to many people is the term "arrhythmia," which literally means 
				"no heartbeat."
				<br/><br/>
				The normal adult heart beats 60 to 100 times each minute.
				In well-trained athletes or even in select non-athletic individuals
				completely at rest, the heart may beat as slowly as 40 to 50 times each minute.
				Entirely healthy, normal individuals have occasional extra beats or minor
				changes in rhythm. These can be caused by drugs(caffeine), stress, or
				for no apparent reason. Dysrhythmias become serious only when they are 
				prolonged or when they do not result in the desired 
				mechanical contraction of the heart.
				<br/><br/>
				Physiologically significant extra heartbeats may originate in
				the upper chambers of the heart (super-ventricular tachycardia 
				or atrial dysrythmia). The cause may be due to a short circuit or
				an extra conduction pathway for the impulse or secondary to some other 
				cardiac pathology. People who have episodes or periods of rapid heartbeat 
				are at risk for losing conciousness during these events. 
				There are also conditions where the person has a fairly stable dysrhythmia 
				(eg. fixed arterial fibrilation), but they usually have additional
				cardiovascular and other health problems that coincide with their 
				rhythm disturbance. A slow heart or heart block may cause symptoms, too.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Fitness and Diving Issue: </b><br/>The more serious dysrhythmias, 
				like ventricular tachycardia and many types of atrial rhythm
				disturbances, are incompatible with diving. The risk for any 
				person developing a dysrhythmia during a dive is, of course, 
				losing consciousness while underwater. Superventricular 
				tachycardias are unpredictable in onset and are often triggered 
				by immersing the face in cold water. Someone who has had more
				than one episode of this type of dysrhythmia should not dive.
				<br/><br/>
				An individual with any cardiac dysrhythmia needs complete medical 
				evaluation by a cardiologist prior to engaging in scuba diving.
				In some cases, thourough conduction (electro-physiologic) studies 
				can identify an abnormal conduction pathway and the problem can be 
				corrected. Recently, doctors and researchers have determined that
				people with dysrhythmias (eg. certain types of Wolff - Parkinson -
				White Syndrome) may safely participate in diving after having a
				thorough evaluation by a cardiologist. Also in select cases,
				some people with stable arterial dysrhythmias (eg. 
				uncomplicated atrial fibrillation) may dive safely 
				if a cardiologist determines that there are no other 
				significant health problems.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>Medications used in treatment:</b> <br/>Most dysrhythmias 
				that require medication are medically disqualifying for safe diving. 
				Exceptions may be made on a case by case basis in consultation with a 
				cardiologist and diving medical officer.
