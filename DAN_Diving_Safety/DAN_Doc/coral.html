				<b>Question:</b><br/><br/> 
				When I was diving some time ago, I apparently came in contact with a type of stinging coral. As soon as I got out of the water I noticed a few cuts and scrapes on the outside of my left wrist and forearm. Later that evening I left an itching and burning sensation around the affected skin; it became red and tender to touch.
					<br/><br/>
				I washed it with soap and hot water, which actually seemed to help. However, the redness, itching and burning lasted for three to four days. The local doctor prescribed a steroid cream twice a day, and everything seemed to heal during the next four to five days.
					<br/><br/>
				Since I returned from my dive trip, the redness and itchy sensations have recurred. The area is uncomfortable and unsightly. Do I need special care?

				<br/><br/>
				<b>Answer:</b><br/><br/>
				It is not uncommon for a diver to have a red raised rash resulting from a coral encounter. A burning sensation, pain and itching may also accompany a rash if the coral is actually a hydroid, such as fire coral, which is not a true coral but a stinging creature. The extent of the reaction to fire coral depends on the amount of exposure to toxins, the extent of the abrasion and victim's pre-existing sensitivity. 
					<br/><br/>
				You did the correct thing to clean the wound with soap and water: Reactions may be reduced by immediately cleansing the affected area. The most frequent complications from non-stinging coral scrapes are inflammation, which leads to poor healing, and less commonly, a secondary infection. Proper cleansing, therefore, is very important.
				<br/><br/>
				If fire coral is the culprit, then treatment with hot water 45C is recommended. This can be applied as a compress or as a soak to reduce the pain. Other substances that have been used with variable effect are rubbing alcohol and baking soda. 
					<br/><br/>
				It is not uncommon for the rash, itching and burning to recur after these symptoms have resolved initially because tiny, microscopic fragments of living coral can remain in the wound. In addition, a cyclic immune response (redness, inflammation, itching and swelling, itching or burning) can persist for a few weeks after the incident.
				<br/><br/>
				Treatment for the inflammatory response is symptomatic. Steroid creams are rarely helpful and they can prolong a skin infection. If the inflammation is severe, systematic steroids in a moderate, tapering dose may be administered under the supervision of a trained medical provider. Oral antihistamines can sometimes help reduce the itching or burning sensation.
						<br/><br/>
				When you are under the water avoid contact with coral or any other living creature. Whenever possible wear a wetsuit or diveskin to protect yourself.
				<br/><br/>
				Ocean divers should consider a marine animal first aid kit for their travels. For divers who want to learn more about the various marine life injuries, DAN has a course as well as a variety of books on this topic. 
					<br/><br/>
				<i>DAN's First Aid for Hazardous Marine Life course is designed to provide divers with knowledge regarding specific types of marine creature injuries and the general first aid treatment for those injuries.</i>
