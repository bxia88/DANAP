				<h3>DAN Answers Your Questions About Dive Medicine </h3><br/>
					<p>This site is designed to provide the answers to
					many common, as well as some less common, 
					questions relating to diving medical issues.
				</p>

			<h3>
			An Introduction
			</h3>
			<p>As scuba diving's appeal broadens to all ages, 
			more individuals with some type of health concern are 
			asking about fitness requirements for scuba diving. Many years ago, when physicians 
			trained in diving medicine began discussing recreational scuba fitness requirements, 
			a "model diver" was created.
			<br/><br/>
			This model diver was the accumulation of medical expertise, diving physiology
			and known disease processes. Restrictions to scuba diving include medical
			conditions and illnesses that might impair or limit a diver's ability to perform underwater.
			<br/><br/>
			Unfortunately, very little research data existed to support many of
			these theoretical restrictions to scuba diving. Now, as it was then,
			it would be unethical to place individuals at risk of injury just to
			prove actual risk is less than what we might expect.
			<br/><br/>
			Some restrictions have changed over the years, however. For example, 
			10 years ago, the fear of hypoglycaemia kept any person taking medication 
			for diabetes out of scuba diving. Today, individuals who control their diabetes 
			with oral medication may dive; and perhaps, once DAN's research on diving with 
			diabetes is completed, the scuba training agencies may accept a select group of 
			insulin-requiring persons with diabetes.
			<br/><br/>
			There are still prospective and current divers who are going to be advised against
			diving because of a medical condition, not just because they have a medical problem 
			but because of the severity of their symptoms. In general, any condition that may impair
			mental or physical performance, induce pain or loss of consciousness, or cause 
			nausea or vomiting must be evaluated before diving. Additionally, there are some
			medical conditions that may be affected by diving physiology, such as some blood 
			disorders which are sensitive to changes in blood volume.
			<br/><br/>
			This site presents some questions that concern chronic and long term illness, as well 
			as short term illness and injury. DAN physicians and others have put together some 
			answers to help explain these medical concerns to divers and their physicians so
			that, together, they can make an informed decision about scuba diving.
			<br/><br/>
			This is one way that we at DAN strive to increase general medical knowledge in 
			the scuba diving community and prevent injuries and deaths related
			to these medical conditons.
