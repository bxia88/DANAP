          <h1>Lessons in Gas Management </h1>
        <p align="justify"><em>Article by DAN's Marty McCafferty </em></p>
        <h2 align="justify">Diver No. 1</h2>
        <p align="justify">A  37-year-old male diver with approximately 30 lifetime dives was doing his first  night dive. It was also his first cold-water and first drysuit dive. He was  healthy and not taking any medications. The diver descended to 95 feet,  breathing air and using a dive computer. He had some difficulty beginning his  descent due to his failure to adjust his weight to compensate for the increased  buoyancy of the drysuit. After some time at the bottom he checked his air  gauges and found he had less than 300 psi remaining. He signaled to his buddy  he was terminating the dive and began to ascend. Because of inexperience, the  ascent was not fully controlled, and the diver reported feeling &quot;close to  panic.&quot; <br />
          <br />
	        Planning sufficient gas reserves to account for unexpected problems helps  ensure divers make it back to the surface with gas to spare. Deeper or more  challenging dives require greater reserves.<br />
          <br />
        After surfacing, he waited for his buddy, and they swam back to shore.  The diver never experienced symptoms, but he contacted DAN® the next  day to discuss the events and inquire if he was still in any danger.</p>
        <h2>	        Diver No. 2</h2>
	      <p>	        A  72-year-old male with hundreds of lifetime dives, including several technical  dives, was participating in a series of wreck dives with three buddies. He was  not known to have any medical conditions or to be taking any medications; he  was reportedly in good general health. The first dive was an uneventful wreck  dive to 112 feet for 28 minutes. The second dive was planned as a shallower  dive, and the diver's three buddies descended ahead of him. His body was later  found floating on the surface a half mile away from the initial descent area.  <img src="../_images/diver_emergency.jpg" width="330" height="495" class="imgRight" />One witness reported the decedent's snorkel was in his mouth when his body was  recovered. His weight belt was not in place, and his tank was empty.  Circumstances indicated he made a buoyant emergency ascent. His computer  recorded a nine-minute dive to 29 feet. Apparently, each of the four divers  used a single tank (per diver) to make both dives. The autopsy findings were consistent  with drowning.</p>
	      <h2>Diver No. 3</h2>
	      <p>            The diver  was a 24-year-old female with approximately 100 lifetime dives. She reported a  history of regular exercise and good general health, and she denied taking any  medications. Her dives were warm-water ocean dives hunting lobster. The first  dive was along a reef structure at a maximum depth of 73 feet, and some time  passed before she located her prey. Trying to capture one lobster required a  short chase and raised her respiratory rate. The diver checked her gauge only  when she became aware of increased breathing resistance. It displayed  &quot;0.&quot; She admitted to panicking and swimming rapidly toward the  surface. She failed to jettison her weights or inflate her BCD, which she would  have to have done orally because of her empty cylinder. Other divers saw her  struggling to keep her head above water and remove the regulator from her  mouth. They helped her return to the dive boat, where she had difficulty  breathing and coughed up pink, frothy sputum. Crew members provided oxygen and  returned to shore, where emergency medical service personnel were waiting. She  was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with seawater aspiration. She  developed pneumonia and was hospitalized for two weeks, after which she was  discharged with no residual problems.</p>
	      <h2> Discussion </h2>
	      <p>	        To many  people who drive a car every day, running out of fuel may seem improbable, but it  is a daily occurrence. Likewise, ineffective breathing-gas management while  diving is a recurrent problem. During peak season, DAN Medicine speaks with at  least two divers every week who have concerns about having made a &quot;rapid  ascent&quot; after finding themselves low on or out of breathing gas. Although  the incidence of fatal injuries is very low, about 41 percent of dive fatalities  involve insufficient breathing gas as the trigger that led to other harmful  events and, ultimately, the death of the diver. Drowning is the leading cause  of death in these situations.<br />
            <br />
	        The reasons behind bad gas management are numerous and varied. The first diver  in this case study introduced new environmental factors (a night dive in cold  water) and new equipment (a drysuit), and he failed to make adjustments for any  of it. As a result, poor buoyancy control, unfamiliar equipment and stressful  dive conditions increased his air consumption and reduced the volume in his  tank faster than usual. He had an adequate gas supply to make a safe ascent,  but his inexperience left him unable to control his ascent rate.<br />
            <br />
	        The second diver started his second dive with a practically empty tank, which  was either an oversight or a bad decision. He followed his training in making a  buoyant emergency ascent, though he clearly ignored it in failing to ensure he  had an adequate gas supply at the start of the dive. The third diver was  involved in vigorous and distracting activities. These increased her  respirations and sped up the depletion of her gas supply, which she did not  monitor carefully. She failed to follow her training by not releasing her  weights to increase her buoyancy at the surface.<br />
            <br />
	        Exertion, stress, anxiety and environmental factors can all increase  respiratory rate. Activities like lobster hunting or spearfishing may consume  gas supplies five to 10 times faster than usual. Wearing too much or too little  weight can cause divers to work harder, increasing gas consumption. Regardless  of factors, however, divers should monitor gas supply frequently and  consistently.</p>  
        <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
        <p>          When planning a dive, incorporate a breathing-gas limit in the plan. For  example, a buddy pair might agree to head back to the exit point when the first  diver has used a third or half of his breathing gas (not counting the reserve  to be left in the cylinder at the end of the dive). Maintaining buddy contact can  make a life or death difference. Safe diving practices and sharpening skills  such as buoyancy control reduce the risk of a breathing-gas emergency but do  not eliminate it completely.</p>
        <p>          Proper responses to breathing-gas emergencies rely on experience and skill  recall. Establishing and practicing responses are essential; confidence in  being able to use an alternate air source provided by a buddy can lead to a  much better outcome. Through planning and practice, effective breathing-gas  management can become second nature and reduce the likelihood of a diving  emergency.<br />
