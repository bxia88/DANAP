        <h1>Checklists .... <em>Keys to Safer Diving? </em></h1>
	      <p>In the past 20 years, dive injuries and fatalities declined even as   participation in scuba diving increased. This decline can be attributed   to better training, equipment, research and access to health care. With   the increase in participation there exists a need for continued   improvement in diver safety. DAN's research is an important part of the   effort to enhance divers' understanding of the risks, promote better   protocols and raise safety awareness in the dive community.</p>
	      <h2>Background	      </h2>
	      <p>We   know the most common causes of dive fatalities are drowning, arterial   gas embolism and cardiac incidents. The majority of these deaths are   labeled drowning, but most experts believe that drowning is usually   preceded by other debilitating injuries. In 2008 a DAN® study   investigated 947 diving deaths and suggested a common chain of events   in these deaths: the triggering event, the disabling agent, the   disabling injury and the cause of death.<br />
            <br />
	        In an earlier study,   researchers used a similar approach to review all work-related deaths in   Australia that occurred from 1982 to 1984, identifying precursor events   and contributing factors. Both these studies concluded that prevention   strategies aimed at reducing triggers and precursor events could reduce   injuries and fatalities.<br />
            <br />
	        It is not easy to look back at accidents   and establish their root causes, but this approach allowed the authors   of both studies to conclude most accidents are caused by preventable   mishaps — unplanned and unwanted events that increase the risk of   injury. The mishaps identified in both studies could be categorised as   human errors, equipment problems or environmental factors. The most   common diving mishaps are out-of-air scenarios, rapid ascents, equipment   problems and entrapment. Reducing mishaps, especially human errors and   equipment problems, seems to be the key to decreasing injuries and   fatalities.</p>
	      <h2>	        Checklists	        </h2>
	      <p>One   way to reduce mishaps is to remember important safety procedures and   follow them. Avoiding, omitting, neglecting or failing to understand the   importance of such procedures leads to human errors. These errors can   compound with increasing stress, difficult-to-operate or malfunctioning   equipment and environmental challenges. A checklist is a handy tool for   reducing errors, improving performance and meeting safety standards. </p>
	      <h2>In Diving          </h2>
	      <p>Standard   predive procedures include a review of equipment, the dive plan and   responses to unplanned events. We hypothesise that the use of a predive   checklist reinforces these steps and reduces mishaps related to human   error and equipment problems. Such reinforcement may be especially   important in recreational diving because of the significant intervals   between dives (months or even years) for many recreational divers.<br />
            <br />
            Checklists   have a long history in diving. U.S. Navy divers employ a thorough   predive checklist before dives, and compliance is strictly regulated.   The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) uses the   acronym &quot;BWRAF&quot; when teaching predive checks to recreational divers. The   acronym stands for <strong>B</strong>CD, <strong>W</strong>eights, <strong>R</strong>eleases, <strong>A</strong>ir and <strong>F</strong>inal OK. Many mnemonics are used, including the well-known &quot;<strong>B</strong>egin <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>R</strong>eview <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>F</strong>riend&quot;   and a colorful variety of others. The National Association of   Underwater Instructors (NAUI) diving manual features various checklists   including one that uses the acronym &quot;SEA BAG.&quot; The safety topics   referenced by this acronym are <strong>S</strong>ite survey, <strong>E</strong>mergency, <strong>A</strong>ctivity, <strong>B</strong>uoyancy, <strong>A</strong>ir, and <strong>G</strong>ear   and go. The intent of this &quot;on-site&quot; checklist is similar to that of a   predive checklist, but it provides a general review of safety   considerations rather than a step-by-step list of tasks to complete. The   American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) also advises divers to   conduct a predive check and provides a format in its manual.<br />
            <br />
            Divers   are trained to conduct predive safety checks and may acknowledge the   benefits checklists offer, but compliance is questionable. The extent to   which any of these checklists are actually used is unknown, and no   formal evaluations of their efficacy have been conducted.<br />
          </p> 
          <h2>Evaluation of a Predive Checklist          </h2>
          <p>There   is no gold standard of predive checklists. With input from   dive-medicine researchers, dive instructors, physicians trained in dive   medicine and diver medical technicians (DMTs), DAN developed a predive   checklist for evaluation. It was pretested on 16 divers in a field   setting to ensure clarity of content, assess the effort involved in   completion and determine the acceptability of the checklist to divers.<br />
            <br />
            To   evaluate the checklist's effectiveness, DAN conducted an intervention   trial in the summer of 2012. The intervention groups of divers used   DAN's predive checklist, while the control group did not. At the end of   each dive day, researchers asked all divers to complete a questionnaire   about diving mishaps. The data were collected and are currently being   analyzed; the incidence of mishaps between the two groups will be   compared.<br />
            <br />
            Extreme depth-time profiles and running low on air are   known to increase divers' risk of injury. To address these variables,   researchers included a dive plan in the intervention: Participants were   asked to plan the depth of their dive and to estimate their   breathing-gas needs at different stages of the dive. Additionally, the   intervention tool included four safety tips and a postdive log for   divers to record actual dive parameters.<br />
            <br />
            If the checklist   promotes closer adherence to safety guidelines as we hypothesize, the   primary benefit will be a decrease in mishaps related to equipment and   human error and a consequent reduction in the incidence of injuries.   Additional benefits from a public health perspective may include a   decrease in the financial burden of treatment costs, a reduction in lost   productive time due to injury, disability or death, and safer, more   enjoyable experiences for divers. The checklist and the results from the   intervention trials will be made public once the analysis is complete.<br />
