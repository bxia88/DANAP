      <h1>Laughing Out of Air </h1>
      <h3>A diver learns the importance of dive-buddy communications and   pre-dive equipment checks when both his regulators fail after removing   them for some underwater laughter.</h3>
      <h6><strong>Reported Story </strong></h6>
              <p>I am an experienced breath-hold and scuba diver with more than 50   dives under my belt. On the day of the incident I was diving at 20m with a group of friends. We started joking around with each   other, as we often do. Whenever I start laughing underwater I take my   regulator out of my mouth. This time before I could replace the   regulator a friend pushed me from behind, and I laughed more. When I   finally replaced my regulator, I was unable to take a breath. I made   several attempts to inhale, all of which were unsuccessful. When I tried   to alert my friends that I was having a problem, they thought I was   joking.</p>
              <p> I checked the remaining pressure, and the gauge indicated   80 bar. I switched to my alternate second stage, but it   didn't supply air either. I was too far from my buddies to grab any of   their alternate air sources. I pressed the power inflator on my BCD and   found that it worked. Despite having adequate pressure, I was unable to   breathe.</p>
      <p> I decided to swim quickly toward the surface. When I   looked to the surface I realized I was not likely to reach it, and the   urge to breathe was unbearable. I accepted that surfacing was not an   option and did not want to allow myself to panic. As a last attempt at   self-rescue, I pressed the purge button on both my primary and secondary   regulators. Both expelled air. I placed my primary regulator back in my   mouth and pressed the purge button and was able to breathe.</p>
              <p> Since   it was working again I decided to terminate the dive and made a   controlled ascent to the surface. This entire event occurred within 15   to 20 seconds. I am usually very comfortable in the water, but this was a   problem I had never anticipated. I had not previously considered   pressing the purge button prior to replacing the regulator.</p>
              <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>Seldom   are dive incidents or accidents due to a single cause. The above case   illustrates how multiple factors are involved, and it is fortunate there   was a positive outcome. It could have easily ended tragically. In this   case several factors should be considered: maintenance of regulators,   predive breath test of the spare regulator, buddy diving, underwater   communication and joking while underwater.</p>
              <p> We know from the   diver's account that his primary regulator was working normally and he   had sufficient a gas supply. How well the diver maintained his equipment   is unknown. Why the regulator did not work properly after removing it   from the mouth is unclear, but there can be reasonable speculation. It   is possible that debris or salt crystals may have prevented the valve in   the second stage to operate normally. It is unknown whether on the   surface prior to the dive the diver breathed from the alternate   regulator, which also could have been blocked by debris or salt   crystals. The negative pressure produced by normal inspiration was   likely not sufficient to free the valve in such case. Manually   depressing the purge button on both regulators produced sufficient   pressure to move the valve. Purging the regulator before returning it   back into mouth should be a standard procedure.</p>
              <p> Proper   maintenance of equipment cannot be overemphasized. Attempting to breathe   from both the primary and alternate regulators while on the surface may   reveal problems that can be dealt with and avoid a potential   catastrophe.</p>
              <p> The above recollection reinforces the need for our   buddy(s) to be within an appropriate and helpful distance. Buddies who   are &quot;within sight of each other&quot; in good visibility may be too far away   for assistance when needed. On the other hand, such practice often   results in buddy separation. In this case the diver himself stated that   his buddies were all too far away for him to reach their alternate   second-stage regulators by himself after an attempt of communicating the   need failed. A problematic situation can deteriorate in a matter of   seconds. DAN data indicate that 40 percent of fatalities involve buddy   separation.</p>
              <p> Along with proper buddy contact, effective   communication is essential. This diver does not report how he tried to   communicate his situation to his buddies. His situation, of course, was   not the typical scenario that we train for. However, using familiar,   accepted hand signals is the best course of action. Reviewing hand   signals with your buddy(s) before the dive is important to make sure   that both divers understand all signals. It is also an opportunity to   review and practice hand signals that are not used often. There is no   substitute for proper equipment maintenance, buddy contact and   communication.</p>
              <p> Above all, it is important to recognize that   although a recreation, diving is a serious business; there is not much   space for joking while diving.<br />
