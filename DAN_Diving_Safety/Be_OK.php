      <h1>You'll Be OK </h1>
      <h3>Reassuring an anxious diver may not always be the right approach.</h3>
      <h2>The Diver      </h2>
      <p>My daughter, who in this article will be referred to as Claire, was a   25-year-old planning dives on the West Coast of the USA. The dives would be her   first since she completed her open-water certification two months   earlier. She contacted the shop that certified her; they told her about   an upcoming charter and assured her the dives would be within her   ability. When she asked about a dive buddy, she was told she would be   paired up on the boat. She mentioned that all her training dives had   been from shore and that this would be her first boat dive. She was told   a dive professional would be onboard to assist her, and she decided to   join the trip.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../_images/anxious_diver.jpg" width="560" height="373" /></p>
      <h2 align="justify"><a href="https://www.onlineexambuilder.com/cardiovascular-health/exam-38346"></a>The Dive </h2>
      <p align="justify">On the way to the dive site, Claire was introduced to her buddy, who   will be called Jake. He had done 18 dives in his lifetime and had not   been diving in more than a year. Almost all his previous dives were in   the Caribbean.<br />
        <br />
        As the boat approached the dive site, both divers   expressed reservations when they learned the dive instructor onboard   would be training a student rather than diving with them. They were told   not to worry and that everything would be fine.
        Jake had difficulty   setting up his equipment and told the instructor his rental BCD was too   tight, which made it hard for him to breathe. Once in the water, Claire   was unable to descend, so the crew slipped additional weight into her   BCD pockets. By the time these problems were resolved, the other divers   had descended. Claire and Jake descended alone.<br />
        <br />
        A plankton bloom,   typical for the season and location, limited visibility near the   surface. The divers overcame their anxiety by giving each other the OK   sign repeatedly as they descended. At about 9m the visibility began   to clear, but it was dark, and neither diver had a light.<br />
        <br />
        About   10 minutes into the dive Jake turned to look at Claire, who had been   swimming right behind him, and realised she was not there. After a   moment he saw someone in the dimness and swam toward the person. As he   approached, he saw it was Claire and realised she was unconscious.   Grabbing her by her BCD, he attempted to ascend. He kicked hard but was   unable to make progress toward the surface. He did not think to release   her weights or inflate her BCD and was soon overcome with exhaustion.   Jake struggled to get enough air through his regulator and began to   panic. He released Claire and headed for the surface, spitting out his   regulator on the way. He hit the surface gasping, choking and unable to   call for help. The captain noticed him struggling and motored over to   him. Unable to talk or breathe, Jake kept pointing down.<br />
        <br />
        Once the   captain realised there was a problem, he made a distress call and   initiated a diver recall by tapping the boat's ladder with a hammer. Not   all divers responded to the call promptly, and some decided to do a   safety stop before surfacing. Precious minutes were lost.<br />
        <br />
        Claire   was found in approximately 18m of water by the instructor and   another diver. CPR was initiated once she was brought aboard, and a   Coast Guard boat arrived to transfer her to an ambulance on shore.   Claire's heart was started in the ambulance on the way to the hospital,   where she was placed on life support in the intensive care unit.<br />
        <br />
        Claire   never regained consciousness. Three days after the accident the doctors   determined she would never have enough brain function to breathe on her   own, and we made the decision to discontinue life support.      </p>
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>Neither Claire nor Jake was sufficiently experienced for this dive.   Claire had never dived without a professional guide, and she had not   dived from a boat before. She relied on someone else to guide her   through the process. Jake had not dived for more than a year and did not   take a skills refresher before the trip. He had never been taught what   to do with an unconscious diver.<br />
        <br />
        Jake had complained prior to the   dive that his BCD was too tight and limited his ability to breathe.   When Claire's regulator was tested after the accident it was determined   to be performing below the manufacturer's specifications. An inability   to breathe properly may have contributed to both Claire's   unconsciousness and Jake's sense of panic as he attempted to assist her   to the surface. Whenever rental equipment is used, its fit and function   should be assessed by the diver who will use it before he or she leaves   the dive shop.<br />
        <br />
        Dive operations should consider greater oversight   and supervision of inexperienced divers, particularly when visibility is   low and the divers are unfamiliar with the site or conditions. Neither   Claire nor Jake had sufficient knowledge to evaluate whether the dive   fell within the scope of their competence. Both divers relied on someone   else's opinion that the dive was appropriate for them. Claire lacked   the experience to know what questions to ask, so she trusted the dive   shop employee who told her not to worry. Jake expressed misgivings about   his equipment and the lack of supervision prior to the dive. Despite   this, he trusted the instructor who told him it would get better once   they were underwater. Both divers decided to go ahead with the dive   despite their apprehensions.<br />
        <br />
        There were many opportunities for   either Claire or Jake to have decided not to dive. New divers may not   have adequate background to anticipate the potential for an accident,   but every diver needs to have ingrained in them the notion that if they   are not feeling good about a dive they should not get in the water.   Divers must be honest with themselves about their ability to do any dive   safely.<br />
        <br />
        Before giving advice or assurances, a dive professional   or experienced diver must be careful to evaluate the conditions from the   perspective of a less-experienced diver. Although it's tempting to tell   a new diver who is showing signs of anxiety &quot;you'll be OK,&quot;   reassurances, however well-intentioned, may be fatal for unprepared or   inexperienced divers.<br />
        <br />
        New divers must be skeptical of others'   assessments and reliant on their own. If it feels like something is   wrong, it very well may be. Take responsibility for your dive. Problems   on the surface are not likely to improve once you're underwater. Whether   it's your fifth dive or your 5,000th, you have the right to call a   dive.</p>
