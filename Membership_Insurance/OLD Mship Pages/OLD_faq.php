          <p><span class="faq">1. Do I have to apply  for both DAN Membership &amp; Treatment Insurance?<a name="faq1" id="faq1"></a></span> </p>
          <p>If you wish to have optional dive injury (treatment) insurance in addition to  your DAN Membership then &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; you do.&nbsp;  DAN Membership provides Emergency Evacuation Cover but does not pay the  costs for treatment.&nbsp; </p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#1faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p><span class="faq">2. Does my DAN  Membership provide dive accident (treatment) insurance?<a name="faq2" id="faq2"></a></span><br />
            No.&nbsp; DAN Membership  covers the cost of an emergency evacuation but it does not cover the associated  treatment costs following an evacuation.&nbsp;  DAN offers several levels of treatment insurance coverage.  In order to be covered for the costs  associated with treatment following a Covered Dive Accident you will need to apply for a  level of Dive Injury Insurance at the time of joining or renewing your DAN  Membership.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#2faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p><span class="faq">3. Can I get insurance without being a DAN Member?<a name="faq3" id="faq3"></a></span><br />

          <p class="b2t"><a href="#4faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">5. Are the optional  insurance benefits in addition to the TravelAssist benefits?<a name="faq5" id="faq5"></a></p>
          <p>            Yes. TravelAssist benefits are offered as part of DAN Asia-Pacific Membership.  While TravelAssist covers emergency evacuation to an appropriate medical  facility it does not cover you for the medical expenses associated with your  treatment following an evacuation.</p>

          <p class="faq">6. Does DAN TravelAssist  need to arrange all evacuations?<a name="faq6" id="faq6"></a></p>
          <p>            DAN TravelAssist MUST arrange all evacuations if they are to  be paid for by DAN TravelAssist.&nbsp; The  determination of the need for an emergency evacuation or medical repatriation  will be made by DAN TravelAssist in consultation with a local attending  physician and payment will be made direct to the evacuation provider by DAN  TravelAssist.</p>

          <p class="b2t"><a href="#7faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">8. A number of  insurance companies offer insurance.&nbsp;  What is the DAN advantage?<a name="faq8" id="faq8"></a></p>
          <p>            DAN are the experts in diving accident management, with a  vast network and experience in dealing with dive emergencies throughout the  world.&nbsp; DAN is Your Dive Safety  Association and because of this you receive more than just an insurance&nbsp; policy.&nbsp;  You receive all the benefits of Membership, such as TravelAssist  benefits, subscription to Alert Diver magazine, and access to Medical  Information.&nbsp; Plus you will be helping  support the funding/provision of 24-hour Diving Emergency Hotlines throughout  the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>            A benefit of DAN Membership is the emergency evacuation  service, DAN TravelAssist. It is a Member benefit that, in the event of an  emergency you need to be airlifted to a medical facility, and you are more than  80km from home, you can access this service through DAN without a fee. You can  use this service during any emergency - even a non-diving one. In order to use  this Member benefit you MUST first contact DAN Travel Assist.</p>

	        <p class="faq">17. What if I am moving or travelling for an extended period away from the address of my DAN registration?<a name="faq17" id="faq17"></a></p>
	        <p>	          Whenever you move from the  address of residence used when you enrolled as a DAN Asia-Pacific Member,  you must inform DAN Asia-Pacific of your new address: phone +61 3 9886 9166 or  email <a href="mailto:info@danasiapacific.org" title="blocked::mailto:info@danasiapacific.org">info@danasiapacific.org</a>.  This is important for insurance regulation purposes and to make sure you  receive all the important Member notices and safety information benefits you  are entitled to. If you will be moving out of the country of  your DAN Registration, or away for an extended period (3 months or more), it is  important that you notify the DAN team in order to ensure a claim is approved  in the event of an accident, and, that you have the appropriate cover for your  new country of residence (or where you will be traveling most of the time)..</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#17faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">18. If DAN is a worldwide organisation why do I need to change region when I move to other parts of the world?<a name="faq18" id="faq18"></a></p>
          <p>If you live in another country (other than from where you joined DAN)  for an extended period of time you might fall under the insurance laws set out  by that country which could be different in some ways to those on which your  policy is structured. </p>
	        <p>As such, it is essential that you inform DAN Asia-Pacific when you are  planning move to another country for a period or three or more months as some  of your benefits may be effected.</p>
	        <p class="b2t"><a href="#18faq">Back to Top</a></p>
	        <p class="faq">19. What does DAN mean  when it states that DAN Insurance is secondary insurance cover?<a name="faq19" id="faq19"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">	          Basically if you have any other pre-existing insurance policies, e.g. travel  insurance, health insurance, and ambulance cover. Your DAN policy becomes  secondary coverage and will pay up to 100% of all remaining eligible expenses.  Please provide DAN with your existing insurance policy details. 
	          If, however, you do not have any other insurance policies DAN  will pay up to 100% of all eligible expenses.</p>
	        <p class="b2t"><a href="#19faq">Back to Top</a></p>
	        <p class="faq">20. Can I take out  insurance cover for all my family members?<a name="faq20" id="faq20"></a></p>
          <p>	          If all the members in your Family Membership are divers then 'yes'. In addition  each Member is permitted to take out a different level of cover depending upon  his or her coverage needs. If you have members under your family membership who  are not divers they need not apply for dive insurance cover, however they will  be covered for TravelAssist benefits including Emergency Evacuation.</p>
	        <p class="b2t"><a href="#20faq">Back to Top</a></p>
	        <p class="faq">21. Are there any  travel distance restrictions on my policy?<a name="faq21" id="faq21"></a></p>
          <p>	          Distance restrictions apply for divers taking out membership ONLY and no  insurance. This restriction states that the illness or injury must occur at  least 80km (measured as a direct route by air) from their registered home address in order to receive the  TravelAssist benefits such as Emergency Evacuation. However, this restriction  is waived for a dive accident involving a Member who has taken out any level of  dive injury insurance coverage.</p>

	        <p class="faq">22. What is a Covered  Diving Accident?<a name="faq22" id="faq22"></a></p>
          <p>	          A Covered Dive means a recreational dive or diving  while a scuba instructor, dive master, underwater photographer, or while  performing research under the auspices and following the diving safety  guidelines equivalent to the American   Academy of Underwater  Scientists (AAUS).&nbsp;&nbsp; A Covered Dive  begins upon entry into the water and ceases upon exit from the water.&nbsp; A Covered Dive must begin while Insurance is  in force.</p>
	        <p>A Diving Accident means an Illness or Bodily Injury  that occurs during a Covered Dive.</p>
	        <p>An Accident means a sudden, unexpected, unusual,  specific event that occurs at an identifiable time and place during a Covered  Dive.</p>

	        <p class="faq">23. What is the period  of coverage for both membership and insurance?<a name="faq23" id="faq23"></a></p>
          <p>Each is for a period of 12-months. </p>

	        <p class="faq">26. Are there any  countries excluded from Emergency Evacuations?<a name="faq26" id="faq26"></a></p>
          <p>	          It is the responsibility of the Member to inquire as to  whether a country is &quot;open&quot; for assistance prior to his/her  departure. The following list will provide some guidance but must not be used  as a definitive listing as it will change from time to time. </p>

	        <p class="faq">28. Should I also take out Travel Insurance?<a name="faq28" id="faq28"></a></p>
          <p>Yes. DAN always encourages divers to take out travel  insurance in addition to their DAN coverage when they travel. Travel Insurance  offers coverage for things that are not covered by DAN Membership or Insurance,  such as medical treatment for non-diving illnesses and accidents and lost  luggage.</p>

			<p class="faq">29. Do I Need General Medical Insurance?<a name="faq29" id="faq29"></a></p>
          <p>If you live in a country where you are not   covered by an adequate National Medical Health Scheme, then you definitely   should have General Medical Insurance to provide coverage for non-diving   accidents and illnesses occurring in your country of   residence.</p>
	        <p>The DAN Dive Injury Treatment Insurance   plans provide coverage for covered diving accidents only. The Standard, Master   and Preferred Plans do not cover medical expenses for non-diving medical   problems.</span></p>
	        <p>The Preferred <U>Plus</U> Plan (available   only to Members who live outside Australia) provides coverage for non-diving   accident medical coverage only if you are outside your country of residence for   a maximum period of 3 months. It does not provide coverage if the non-diving   accident occurs within your country of residence.</p>

	        <p class="faq">30. Are Snorkelling, Freediving and Spearfishing covered by  DAN AP's Dive Injury (Treatment) Insurance?<a name="faq30" id="faq30"></a></p>
          <p>Treatment for injuries resulting from recreational  snorkelling, freediving and spearfishing is covered under the Master, Preferred  and Preferred Plus Plans. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Standard Plan does <u>not</u> cover snorkelling, freediving or spearfishing. </p>

			<p class="faq">31. Can I apply for coverage if I live on a boat?<a name="faq31" id="faq31"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">If you are living on a boat and travelling on this for periods greater than three-months you cannot join DAN Asia-Pacific and should join DAN World. </p>
	        <p align="justify">DAN World's Website is: <a href="http://www.danworld.ky">www.danworld.ky</a></p>

          <p class="faq">32. If I want to dive deeper than 50 metres on the Preferred Plan, what certification do I need?<a name="faq32" id="faq32"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">With the Preferred Plan it is stated that a person is covered for a Diving Accident sustained on a dive toany depth provided that the Insured held appropriate certification for the dive, and was using appropriate breathing gas mixes and equipment during the dive or Repetitive Dive Series.</p>
          <p align="justify">The Preferred Plan is partly designed to provide higher coverage limits for those who desire these. It is also designed to provide coverage for a ‘technical’ diver who has the required training and/or experience to dive in reasonable safety beyond 50 m, as long as they are doing so using appropriate equipment and breathing gas. This limitation was introduced to encourage divers to think carefully and be appropriately prepared before they undertake very deep dives. </p>
<p align="justify">In the event of a claim for a dive beyond 50 m, the appropriateness of a particular dive may be assessed by suitable diving medical and/or technical experts looking at the diver's training and certification, as well as their experience at or around the depth of the dive where the accident occurred, to determine if the dive plan was reasonable for that diver.  </p>

<p class="faq">33. If I am lost at sea or otherwise stranded or lost on land or at sea, is &quot;Search and Rescue&quot; covered with my Membership Evacuation benefit?<a name="faq33" id="faq33"></a></p>
          <p align="justify">No, Emergency Evacuation does not include efforts to locate a person (injured or un-injured) whose location is unknown, or efforts to rescue such persons from a dangerous situation or location.</p>
