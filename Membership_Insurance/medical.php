	      <h1><strong>Declared Medical Condition Information </strong></h1> 
          <p><strong>Scroll down the page to find the information that pertains to your declared medical condition/s. </strong>In future please ensure that you continue  to declare your medical condition/s with your insurance  application.</p>
          <h2><strong>Cardiac Causes </strong> </h2>
          <p>Fatalities from cardiac events while diving  and snorkelling have become increasingly common as older people take up diving,  and younger divers age. Diving (and snorkelling) can add substantial additional  cardiac stressors in the form of exertion, immersion, sometimes heavy and  restrictive equipment, increased breathing effort, salt water aspiration and  anxiety, among others. This can be a recipe for causing a cardiac event in  someone with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, whether diagnosed or not. It  is important that any diver with a known cardiac problem discusses their  personal situation with a doctor who is aware of the cardiac stressors involved  with diving. DAN AP recommends that all divers have regular health checks. For  males aged 45 and females aged 55 this should include a cardiovascular  assessment.  </p>
          <h2><strong>Diabetes</strong></h2>
        <p>The major concern with diving and diabetes  is the potential for suffering severe hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels),  causing a reduced level of consciousness or mobility in the water. Factors such  as exercise, stress and a variety of others can lower blood sugar levels  substantially and, unless the diver is well-controlled and well-monitored, an  accident could result. In addition, the usual cues of hypoglycaemia may not be  obvious in the underwater environment. It is recommended that all diabetic  divers and their treating doctors familiarize themselves with the current  Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Guidelines.  <br />
            <br />
Please also note that you will need to  download a copy of the <a href="../DAN_diving_safety/DAN_Doc/diabetes.html">Diabetes Guidelines.</a></p>
          <h2>Hypertension</h2>
          <p>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure), whether  treated with medication or not, may be associated with an increased risk of  cardiac problems and stroke (cerebrovascular disease).&nbsp; In addition,  certain medications used in the management of hypertension may have undesirable  consequences for the diver (such as beta-blockers limiting physical exertion or  increasing the potential for pulmonary oedema, or diuretics leading to  dehydration).&nbsp;This can sometimes lead to serious problems.&nbsp;Therefore  we advise that you discuss the management of your hypertension and the choice  of medication with your treating doctor.</p>
          <h2>Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)</h2>
          <p>Divers  with a PFO appear to be at a (sometimes) substantially greater risk of  decompression illness (DCI) as venous bubbles can be shunted into the arterial  circulation though the PFO. Diving conservatively to minimize bubbles should  reduce the likelihood of a problem. Staying <em>well  away</em> from dive computer and table limits, ascending slowly, doing safety  stops, increasing surface interval times and minimizing the number of  repetitive dives should reduce bubble formation. </p>
          <h2>Pre-Existing Injury</h2>
          <p>Certain injuries can reduce the mobility of  a diver and may increase the potential for an accident while diving. In  addition, pre-existing injury is often associated with scar tissue and reduced  circulation and so may increase the likelihood of decompression illness. Divers  with pre-existing injuries are advised to dive within their capabilities and to  be more conservative in their diving profiles to reduce the likelihood of DCI.</p>
          <h2>Previous Decompression Illness (DCI) </h2>
          <p>If you have had a previous episode of decompression  illness (DCI) or suspected DCI, it is possible in most cases to return to  diving once cleared to do so by a diving physician. However, it is usually  advisable to dive more conservatively as there may be an increased risk of a  future DCI episode.  <br />
            <br />
        DAN makes available to Members a valuable  information booklet called <em>Decompression  Illness</em>*, authored by DAN Asia-Pacific Founder, and dive safety author John  Lippmann. The booklet provides useful recommendations to reduce the risk of DCI,  and include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Restricting depths to less than about 30       metres. </li>
            <li>Avoiding mandatory decompression.</li>
            <li>Using conservative dive times (e.g. setting       dive computer to a more conservative setting can help).</li>
            <li>Ascending slowly and doing a safety stop       (or stops).</li>
            <li>Limiting the number of daily dives. </li>
            <li>Extending surface intervals (a minimum of 2       hours, where possible). </li>
            <li>Using nitrox (with an air setting on the       dive computer). </li>
          </ol>
          <p>You can find additional information in the booklet pertaining to signs &amp; symptoms, risk factors for DCI, prevention of DCI, and diving with a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO).           </p>
          <h2 align="left"><strong>Advice for Divers Aged Over 45</strong></h2>
          <p>DAN statistics highlight that there has been a significant  increase in diving-related deaths involving divers over about 45 years of age.  Many of these deaths result from cardiac-related problems that were  precipitated by the numerous cardiac stressors in the diving environment, which  include:</p>
          <p>- Exertion</p>
          <p>- Immersion</p>
          <p>- Wearing heavy and restrictive equipment</p>
          <p>- Breathing denser gas at increased partial  pressures. </p>
          <p>These incidents often occur in divers who were unaware of  any pre-existing problems. </p>
          <p>As a diving safety initiative, DAN AP encourages divers aged  45 and older to consult a doctor, preferably one trained in diving medicine  (who should be more aware of the stressors of the diving environment), to  discuss their diving and health and determine whether any particular testing is  advisable. Often a good medical history and examination will suffice; however,  sometimes an exercise stress test and/or an ultrasound of the heart may be  thought to be appropriate.</p>
