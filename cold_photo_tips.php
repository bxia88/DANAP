	  <h1>Pro Tips for Shooting in Cold Water</h1>
	  <p><em>Photos and Tips By Stephen Frink	    </em></p>
	  <p align="center"><img src="_images/sfrink_1409.jpg" alt="DAN" width="541" height="297" border="0" /></p>
	  <p>All underwater photographers, at some point in their  shooting life, will find themselves captivated by the unique subjects found  only in temperate or cold water. Whether you're shooting the white sharks of  Guadalupe and South Australia, the wolf eels of British Columbia, the  shipwrecks of Scapa Flow or the leopard seals in Antarctica, here are five pro  tips for capturing better images in cold water.</p>
	  <h2><strong>Tip #1: Get Adequate Thermal Protection </strong></h2>
	  <p>It's hard to take great images when your teeth are  chattering, your fingers are frozen, and your only conscious thoughts are  focused on getting somewhere warm. Any serious shooter working in cold  conditions will embrace drysuit technology. One word of caution: Trying to  master the intricacies of a new drysuit while concentrating on underwater  photography is a recipe for trouble. I strongly advise photographers to get  familiar with any new exposure protection and accessories before adding an  underwater camera and strobes to the mix. Drysuit diving will require far more  weight than light tropical wetsuits, and compensating for that weight at depth  can be tricky at first. A little practice mastering your buoyancy now will pay  off in safer dives and better photos later. <br />
        <br />
Finding the right gloves can be a challenge. Tropical gloves, which allow  terrific maneuverability, will soon prove painful in cold water. Since any  discomfort that shortens the dive will also decrease the efficiency of the  photo outing, this is a tough compromise. I've tried the three-finger titanium  mitts, and while they are very warm, they were clumsy when accessing small  dials and buttons on my digital housing. The best solution I've found: dry  gloves.</p>
	  <h2>Tip  # 2: <strong>Adjust for Colour and Clarity</strong></h2>
	  <p>They don't call the waters off British Columbia &quot;The  Emerald Sea&quot; for no reason. The color of the cold water is often quite  different than the bright cyan we find in the tropics. <br />
        <br />
Digital cameras have considerable latitude in terms of color temperatures used  to record the image. Many have presets such as &quot;cloudy day&quot; (a good  default for use in clear tropical waters) that adjust the white balance  settings. Others have manual color temperature settings in degrees Kelvin. Here  is a general guideline for approximate color temperatures in degrees Kelvin as  recognized by digital cameras. Lower temperatures are at the red/yellow end of  the color spectrum, with higher temperatures at the blue/green end. </p>
	  <ul type="disc">
        <li>2000       candlelight</li>
	    <li>3000       tungsten and halogen</li>
	    <li>3500       early morning and late afternoon sun</li>
	    <li>4200       fluorescent </li>
	    <li>5000       daylight and flash</li>
	    <li>6000       cloudy day</li>
	    <li>8000       shade </li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>My preference when working in  green water is to tweak the color balance somewhat lower than I might in  tropical waters. For example, I typically shoot at 5700 degrees Kelvin in the  clear blue of the Caribbean, but I like to go to 5200 degrees in greenish  water. The goal is not to make the water look blue, but to tone down the  excessive green cast. Remember, white balance is a global control, so adjusting  for the color bias of the water column will also affect the daylight-balanced  strobe light striking your subjects. Going too low on the scale will distort  the reality of the image and seriously misrepresent the colors in the  strobe-lit foregrounds. <br />
          <br />
	    When capturing RAW images in a digital camera, the white balance can be  properly assigned at the time of capture or, if done incorrectly, reassigned  using software in &quot;post.&quot; While considerable control is still  possible when shooting JPGs for digital capture, RAW is far more forgiving for  correcting deviations in color balance. <br />
  <br />
	    With film, there are essentially two choices: Use a special film for each light  condition, or use a filter to block a given color cast. <br />
  <br />
	    Sometimes cold water is very clear; more often it is not. The wild card is organisms  and detritus held in suspension in the water, as it can affect both color and  visibility. I typically assume visibility will be marginal and use lighting and  composition techniques accordingly to minimize backscatter.</p>
	  <h2>Tip #3: <strong>Adjust  for Ambient Light</strong></h2>
	  <p>Low levels  of ambient light tend to be a major issue in cold waters, whether it is because  of ice pack, kelp fronds, suspended particles absorbing light or simply the  angle at which the sun strikes the surface of the water. With the camera ISO  set to 200, I've noticed that light meter readings at 30 ft (9 m) are usually  around f/8 in the tropics, whereas in cold water f/2.8 is more the norm. The  angle of light is important to consider as well. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Vertical light.</strong> This is the light that penetrates from the surface and  is modified by cloud condition, time of day, surface conditions, water clarity  and depth. Obviously, sunny days transmit more light than cloudy days, noon  more than dusk, slick water more than waves, clear more than turbid and shallow  more than deep. The best solution to dealing with low levels of vertical light  is to slow down the shutter speeds to allow more ambient light in the  background. This is especially important in wide-angle shots. <br />
        <br />
For wide-angle shots of sedentary subjects, I recommend shutter speeds of  1/30th of a second and slower. This does not affect the strobe light striking  the primary subject in the foreground but can change a background from black to  light green. The other way to get more ambient light in the background without  overexposing strobe-lit foregrounds is to combine wider apertures with a lower  strobe power setting. If greater depth-of-field is still required, going to a  higher ISO will work wonders. <br />
<br />
<strong>Horizontal light.</strong> Even at strobe-to-subject distances of 3 ft (1 m) or  less, the power settings and apertures that work in tropical waters will need  refinement. Not only does the water column absorb more light, many of the  creatures, as a function of their protective coloration, reflect less light  than their Caribbean counterparts. As an example, look at the difference in  color between a Caribbean octopus and a giant octopus from British Columbia.  Clearly, a subject whose environment includes a white sand bottom will need  different stealth strategies than one who lives among dark rock and kelp.  Thankfully, the digital review will give instant feedback on exposures, but  assume more light will be necessary for both vertical and horizontal  considerations.</p>
	  <h2>Tip  #4: <strong>Sharpen Your Focus</strong></h2>
	  <p>Low light  levels at depth and lack of contrast between subject and background make it  difficult to depend on auto-focus in cold water. Sometimes the sheer density of  life cloaking the rocks in places like Alaska or the Poor Knights in New  Zealand is so extreme the camera can have a hard time discerning precise focus.  This is where a good modeling light can be a huge asset. It can be the light  built into the strobe, like the LED beam on an Ikelite DS160, or it can be an  external auto-focus assist light from lighting specialists such as Light and  Motion or the popular new FIX LED Focus lights from Fisheye. Ultralight Control  Systems also makes a variety of adapters that thread into an accessory mount on  a housing to mount flashlights from a variety of manufacturers. It isn't rocket  science to fix the auto-focus deficiencies that happen in dark water, but  unless you come prepared, the dives will be frustrating and the  &quot;keeper-rate&quot; will go low. <br />
          <br />
	    There may be circumstances where auto-focus simply won't work, so serious  cold-water shooters must learn to embrace manual focusing. The best housings  offer the creative control to access either manual or auto-focus, but the  lenses typically have to be equipped with focus gears.</p>
	  <h2>Tip  #5: <strong>Get Close</strong></h2>
	  <p>With so many small, colorful creatures in cold-water  environments, a macro-telephoto lens is very useful. While many of the sessile  creatures will tolerate the closer proximity required to fill the frame with a  60mm macro lens (speaking in full-frame equivalency), compositions from a  greater distance allow greater flexibility in strobe positioning. The more  skittish creatures are best approached at a slightly greater distance anyway.<br />
        <br />The size of the subject and the proximity it allows will  pretty well determine the optimal optic. If that happens to be a large marine  mammal, like Nicklen's classic leopard seal, a wide-angle lens is crucial.  Medium-sized fish like Pacific octopus, sculpin or wolf eels are perfect for  zoom lenses like the Canon 17-40mm that focus close but have the versatility to  cover both wide scenics and marine life portraits. Your macro lenses will get a  good workout in cold water, as they allow magnification of 1:1 and closer (for  those incredibly colorful and intricate invertebrates), and they typically lock  focus very efficiently in low light. <br />
          <br />
	    The point is not so much about exactly which lens to use but to recognize that  the best photos will occur at very near distances. Getting close to your  subject also enhances strobe penetration, minimizes backscatter from suspended  particles and ensures the best possible image resolution. <br />
