          <h1><strong>Symptoms You Should Not Ignore After Diving</strong></h1>
          <p><em>Article by DAN’s Joel Dovenberger, with comments by John Lippmann. </em></p>
          <p>Each year  DAN receives thousands of emergency and information calls. Most calls are basic  fitness-for-diving questions, but many calls involve a diver with symptoms  after diving. These symptoms may herald the occurrence of Decompression Illness  (DCI) in a diver.</p>
          <p>The type  of symptom, its severity and onset time after the dive usually indicate the  need for evaluation. Divers don't always seem to grasp the urgency of this  situation. That's why DAN is here: to help divers make the next step.</p>
          <p>While this  article does not include every symptom of DCl, it highlights the most common symptoms;  those DAN thinks every diver should know. If after diving you experience signs  and symptoms that you’re concerned about, call a DAN supported hotline early,  as soon as you begin to worry about your condition.</p>
          <p>After a  brief telephone assessment, DAN diving medical specialists usually refer  callers to local physicians, emergency departments or urgent care clinics. Once  the referral is made for possible DCI, local medical personnel conduct an  evaluation: This can result in a diagnosis of DCI and a trip to a recompression  chamber facility or another diagnosis and appropriate medical care. Medical  professionals might suspect DCI, but for proper diagnosis a thorough medical  evaluation is needed.</p>
          <p>Delays are  common. DAN often encounters divers who choose to wait before calling for  assistance, even when their symptoms need immediate action. ln some cases,  divers have waited more than 24 hours before they call for help. The rationale?  They want to see whether their symptoms will go away without medical care.  Those symptoms can sometimes be very serious.</p>
          <p>Sometimes  the delay is understandable; symptoms are often new to the diver and with no  previous experience with DCl, they may feel their symptoms are minor, unimportant or represent  either an old injury or a recent activity.</p>
          <p>Sometimes this is true, but DAN  encourages any diver with symptoms after diving to contact a <a href="emergency/hotline_numbers.php">DAN supported  Diving Emergency Hotline</a> so that a  specialist can make this assessment and valuable time is not lost in cases  where early first aid and treatment can really make a difference.</p>
          <h2>What to look for </h2>
          <p>The  obvious question for divers is this: &quot;Which symptoms should I be concerned  about after a dive?&quot; Clearly, not every ache and pain after diving  indicate DCl. Many times an increase in exertion with any type of exercise can  result in muscle or joint soreness, stiffness and general discomfort,  especially for those who do not exercise, do so sporadically or who are  infrequent divers. Even with minimal exposures, new divers may also experience  symptoms following dives. </p>
          <p><em>How does DAN help? </em>While DAN doesn’t diagnose divers'  symptoms over the telephone, helping divers sort out their symptoms after  diving is something DAN has been doing successfully for 30+ years. Most  symptoms probably will require that a physician evaluate the diver, not because  the symptom might indicate DCl, but because proper treatment requires an  appropriate assessment. It will take a medical practitioner's assessment and  diving insight to diagnose DCI and find the relationship among dive profiles,  previous medical history – including acute and chronic illness and injury – and  the symptoms a diver is experiencing.</p>
          <p>The  following symptoms and situations are some of the more common scenarios (but  certainly not the only ones!) here DAN encourages divers to take heed and to  call for an assessment. They represent many calls in which pain, paresthesia  (tingling or numbness), balance , walking difficulties and respiratory problems  were  primary reasons to call DAN. Often  those symptoms occurred many hours after divers realised they simply weren't  feeling well.</p>
          <p><strong>Should you or a dive buddy experience any of these symptoms we advise  you to call DAN or act immediately:</strong></p>
          <h2><strong>Post-dive Pain</strong></h2>
          <p>            Each year  DAN's Annual Diving Report lists pain as the most common first symptom reported  to DAN in cases of DCl. Thus, divers need to pay attention when they experience  muscle, joint and body pain after diving. Many times the pain results from  using muscles that are not commonly used in regular activity. Interestingly,  these aches and pains change with movement or activity; they may completely  disappear or remain positional- that is, divers can find positions in which  they do not experience any discomfort, such as sitting with arms resting on a  table. Depending on the level of discomfort, the diver may need to see a  physician immediately. </p>
          <p>For  divers, non-DCl pain is more common than DCI-related pain. Non-DCI pain  resolves without treatment after the diver has rested, often by the next  morning. As a result of this, many divers have adopted a &quot;wait and  see&quot; attitude. This works well for the divers with simple post-exercise  aches and pains, but it works against the diver who is actually experiencing  mild DCI or the beginnings of a more serious pressure-related injury. Too often  divers wait a day or more to call DAN or seek medical assistance. They had  hoped the pain would resolve, but they find instead that it does not go away  and/or it worsens instead.</p>
          <h2><strong>The warning signs</strong></h2>
          <p>            Over the  years, from thousands of conversations with divers who were ultimately  diagnosed with DCI, we have identified characteristics that can serve as  warning signs to help guide divers and dive professionals at the dive site.</p>
          <p>DCI pain  can occur within minutes – or hours – after a dive. Usually constant, it does  not change with movement. It may start in a hand or wrist and expand to the  forearm or shoulder on the same extremity. The pain is often disproportionate  to the amount of effort<br />
            extended  on a dive or dives. Divers most often describe the pain as a different sort of  pain than they have previously experienced, and there is no sign of trauma,  such as redness or broken skin, at the pain site (Note: although sometimes  there can be an associated skin rash). It can easily occur in an area where  there has never been a history of injury or recent trauma.</p>
          <p>Gradual  symptom onset with increasing intensity can mislead divers; seeking relief,  they may self-medicate with non-steroidal medications like aspirin or  ibuprofen. Some will rehydrate with their favourite beverage. While these  methods may change the pain's intensity they are not effective treatments for  DCl. Plus, the small relief they may provide could give false hope that the  problem isn't DCI and therefore extend the wait time before the diver calls  DAN.</p>
          <h2><strong>Paraesthesia </strong></h2>
          <p>            This  symptom is better known to divers as numbness, tingling, so called “pins and  needles” feelings or altered skin sensations. It also frequently occurs in  combinations with pain. </p>
          <p>Paraesthesia  is more subtle than pain. A diver may sense only a change in touch to the skin  or perhaps not notice a sensation is lacking in a small area of skin. This is  an excellent reason why divers are referred for a medical evaluation once they  have called DAN about their symptoms. Divers can describe only the symptoms they  are aware of; they may be unaware of the loss of sensation on their backs or a  more serious symptom such as weakness in one or both legs. While weakness is  more serious than a mild tingling sensation, it can go undetected without a  medical evaluation.</p>
          <p>Like pain,  several medical conditions might cause a diver to experience paraesthesia. Few  are known to have a sudden onset like DCI, but one such condition is anxiety  with hyperventilation (rapid breathing). This can cause tingling in both hands  and both feet and with serious anxiety can lead to loss of consciousness while  a diver is still in the water.</p>
          <p>Two common  conditions cause paraesthesia in one or more extremities: carpel tunnel  syndrome, which causes both pain and paraesthesia in the hands, and spinal  nerve impingement, a condition that results from ageing or back trauma.</p>
          <p>Any  complaint of paraesthesia after a dive needs to be evaluated and a physician  should determine the root cause of the symptoms. Divers should not take a  &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude about paraesthesia.</p>
          <h2><strong>Balance Problems</strong></h2>
          <p>            Balance  and walking difficulties represent a very serious, though infrequent side  effect of DCl. There may be other reasons for having balance or walking  difficulties, such as middle ear barotrauma or head injuries. Due to the  serious nature of balance problems, medical professionals should sort out  issues of vertigo/dizziness/balance. Whether they believe symptoms are due to  sinus barotrauma or middle ear barotrauma or possibly something more serious,  divers and dive leaders should make the call to DAN.</p>
          <p>Likewise,  problems with walking should always be taken seriously. Walking difficulties may  be a sign of weakness and paraesthesia in the legs; this requires immediate medical  attention. If the spinal cord is involved, then bowel and bladder function may  also be impaired and can go unnoticed until documented with a medical  examination.</p>
          <h2><strong>Rash</strong></h2>
          <p>            Increasingly,  DAN is receiving reports of divers displaying a red or reddish-blue mottled  rash after diving. Rashes can be caused by a large variety of things, such as  allergy, various marine organisms, chemicals in the water, among others.  However, rashes can also be associated with decompression illness and can  sometimes be a useful warning signal. More serious symptoms may or may not be  present or follow. Over recent years there have been numerous cases of divers  who have reported mottled rashes after diving, having later been diagnosed with  a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO can increase the likelihood of serious  decompression illness. Such a rash may disappear with oxygen breathing but  divers are well advised to call a DAN Hotline and get prompt advice. </p>
          <h2><strong>Respiratory Difficulties</strong></h2>
          <p>            Everyone should  know that you must have good pulmonary (lung-related) health to participate in  scuba. Difficulty breathing after a diver can represent a number of medical  issues, not just barotrauma. Many things can happen during a dive that will  produce breathing difficulties or even barotrauma. Respiratory symptoms are  especially important for divers because they represent numerous potential  injuries to and complications for the lung. </p>
          <p>Although  breathing difficulty is not a common DCI symptom, it does occur in conjunction  with other symptoms. Just because divers don’t show the more common symptoms of  DCI, they should maintain critical self-awareness, especially after a dive  incident. It is because the lungs are vital to gas exchange and circulation  that divers should not wait to call for assistance if they have sustained an injury  or if a medical condition has been intensified by diving.</p>
          <p>Besides  shortness of breath, injured divers often complain of chest pain, chest burning  and chest pressure. The difficulty is this: While all three terms may mean  something different to the observer, they may indicate something else to a  medical professional who factors in medical history and the circumstances of  the dive.</p>
          <p>Without  appropriate diagnostic testing, a diver cannot determine whether chest pain or  chest pressure is from barotrauma related to a rapid ascent, straining while  underwater, a lack of fitness, a previous medical condition or the onset of a  heart problem related to exertion. Don’t take chances: Call DAN or get a  medical facility involved.</p>
          <h2><strong>Get treatment, even after oxygen</strong></h2>
          <p>            Divers  have reported the recurrence of serious symptoms when they received no  follow-up treatment after first aid. Symptoms may have partially or even fully  resolved after receiving oxygen only to recur or worsen when oxygen provision  was ceased prematurely and/or there was no further treatment. (e.g. in  situations where transport to a recompression facility will take some time, DAN  AP often advises divers to breathe oxygen constantly for 4 to 5 hours. It is  important to stay on oxygen until told to stop by a diving physician {not  simply a dive instructor as is sometimes the case!}).</p>
          <p>Why?  Oxygen is just the first step in the healing process after a pressure-related  dive injury: A decompression injury usually requires further treatment in the  form of recompression therapy. While oxygen is the correct first aid treatment  and may initially help, it is not the definitive treatment for DCI.</p>
          <p>Act! Don’t  waste time with possible self-diagnosis or by getting a consensus among your  dive buddies. While serious cases are relatively infrequent, quick thinking and  action by those involved can have a positive effect on the outcome of injured  divers.</p>
          <h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Call early if you are a diver with symptoms.</li>
            <li>Boost your knowledge of what to look  for through courses and careful observation.</li>
            <li>Know that divers can be fooled by symptoms.</li>
            <li>Oxygen first aid should be commenced as  soon as possible after a dive-related illness or injury if recognised and  continued until a dive medical physician advises otherwise.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is  not a complete list of DCI symptoms. The list does, however, represent post-dive  symptoms about which many divers may not show concern. Divers should be  especially concerned when symptoms come on shortly after a dive, especially  those occurring within the first hour. Use this article – and your continuing  dive education – to assist you in making the decision to call for assistance  when you or a dive buddy exhibit symptoms. </p>
