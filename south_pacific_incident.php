        <h1>Full Treatment </h1>
         
        <p><em>Article by Mart McCafferty </em></p>
        <h2>The Diver</h2>
        <p>The diver was a 44-year-old male recreational scuba diver, certified for   more than 10 years, who was active in the sport and had no known   medical conditions. During a two-week dive vacation in the South   Pacific, he completed 36 dives on air over a 12-day period. His deepest   dive in the series was to 100 feet, and his last dive was to 75 feet for   60 minutes. All dives went as planned, and he denied any history of   rapid ascents, gear malfunctions or decompression obligations. </p>
        <h2>The Incident</h2>
        <p>When he surfaced from his 36th and final dive, he lost feeling in his   lower back and legs. His condition rapidly progressed to include loss of   vision and lower-extremity muscular weakness. He required assistance   getting into the boat and was immediately placed on high-concentration   oxygen via a demand regulator. He had a brisk response to oxygen and   reported feeling normal after 30 minutes of therapy, at which point   oxygen treatment was discontinued. Physical examination revealed that he   still had weakness and sensory deficits in his legs. Taking no chances,   the boat crew arranged transport to the nearest medical facility for   evaluation and recompression. The time from developing symptoms until   the initiation of hyperbaric treatment was approximately two hours. </p>
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>This individual suffered from an acute injury to his nervous system,   most likely due to decompression illness. Blindness and weakness of both   legs immediately after ascent may have occurred due to arterial gas   embolism (AGE) and/or spinal cord decompression sickness (DCS). These   two types of injuries can be difficult to distinguish, but the treatment   for both is the same. The attending physician diagnosed DCS Type II   (neurological). The diver was treated with a single U.S. Navy Treatment   Table 6, after which most of his symptoms resolved, but he still   suffered from tingling in his feet and experienced generalized fatigue. <br />
          <br />
        Three days after hyperbaric oxygen treatment, he flew home but   continued to experience symptoms. He called DAN® and was referred to a   local hyperbaric/dive physician for follow-up care.</p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>Residual symptoms after treatment are not unusual, especially when the   initial injury is severe. Fortunately, the general trend is progressive   symptom improvement over time. <br />
          <br />
          Although this diver participated in a multiple-day/multiple-dive   schedule, he reported that he was always within his computer's no-<br />
          decompression   limits. Despite this, he wasdiagnosed with a severe case of   neurological DCS. This case speaks to the potential for<br />
          DCS even when dives are done within &quot;limits.&quot; <br />
          <br />
          Remember, decompression models vary among dive computers even   from the same manufacturer. In addition, some computers let divers   modify their safety margins, and thus no-decompression limits do not   always represent the same level of safety. In fact, the decompression   stress of dives reportedly done within no-decompression limits may vary   significantly as an individual's capacity to accommodate decompression   stress can vary on any given day or dive. <br />
          <br />
          Divers must remember that a number of variables can affect our   response to decompression stress, not the least of which is our   underlying health. Fitness to dive is a combination of our medical   history (long- and short-term issues) and physical condition. Another   important factor is the level of exertion during a dive. An unexpected   long swim back to the boat or shore may push an individual to his or her   limits. Dehydration and cold water also influence decompression stress   and may contribute to the onset of DCS. All of these factors need to be   considered together to maximize safety and minimize risk. Focusing   solely on a computer's no-decompression limit does not guarantee an   injury-free dive.<br />
          <br />
          Divers can take a number of important lessons   from this case. The first is that numbness and weakness in the legs   within minutes of surfacing should be regarded as an emergency requiring   immediate medical attention. The diver should be treated with oxygen as   soon as possible and put under the care of a knowledgeable physician.   Untreated, these symptoms may worsen or result in permanent disability. <br />
          <br />
          Emergency oxygen is important as it facilitates nitrogen   off-gassing and supplies compromised tissues with needed metabolic   support. The rate and extent of symptom resolution will vary, but   decompression injury cannot be determined solely on the response to   emergency oxygen. Divers must be evaluated by a medical professional,   even when they say they feel normal or appear to have made a complete   recovery. There are subtle signs and symptoms that the diver or first   responder may not be aware of that indicate injury and the need for   definitive treatment. The strength of a large muscle, for example, may   be easier to assess than short-term memory problems. Properly trained   personnel seek out these subtle signs during a thorough physical and   neurological examination. <br />
          <br />
          Do not dismiss symptoms that seem to clear with emergency   oxygen. There are multiple reports of divers whose symptoms appear to   have resolved only to return hours later. The symptoms may even worsen   on return. Remember, hyperbaric oxygen (i.e., chamber treatment) is the   only definitive treatment for decompression illness.<br />
          <br />
When   a diver experiences symptoms of decompression illness, follow emergency   first aid protocols, which should include oxygen at high concentrations   and transportation to the nearest medical facility for further   evaluation. The method of oxygen administration should enable the   highest concentration of oxygen possible. This can be via a demand valve   regulator (preferred) or by mask. If oxygen is delivered by continuous   flow, gas supply becomes an issue, and the time/distance from definitive   medical care requires consideration when forming an emergency action   plan. (The standard oxygen flow rate employed by emergency medical   services is 10-15 liters/minute when using a continuous flow mask.) Most   important, make sure the diver stays on oxygen either until the supply   is exhausted or he is evaluated by a medical professional. DAN is   available for medical consultation  to help guide   appropriate care for possible decompression incidents. </p>
