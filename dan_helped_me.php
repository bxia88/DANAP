          <h1>DAN Helped Me</h1>
	      <p>The following divers are grateful they were DAN Members. They each experienced a diving incident and DAN was on-hand to help them get through it. &nbsp; </p>
          <p>If you would like to say  something about your experience with DAN<a href="Contact_DAN.php"> send us an email</a>.</p>
          <h2>DAN Members Express their Thanks</h2>
          <div class="imageCenter">
		  
		  <p> Dear John,

I just wanted to say thank you so much for being there for me when I needed 
advice and support regarding my skin bend in Sri Lanka - it was a relief to know you were available even though we were so remote. You also gained a couple of new members out of it, as my diving buddies saw firsthand DAN in action and were really impressed.
            <br />
            <span class="sred">Sue, Australia </span> <br />

		    <strong>Background to case:</strong> Sue was diving on the wreck of the Hermes in Sri Lanka. She developed a decompression-related rash, which disappeared while breathing oxygen. However, the oxygen-breathing period was too short and the rash reappeared. After several further hours of oxygen breathing the rash abated. (We often recommend 4-5 hours of continuous breathing of near-100% oxygen). We tried to call her several times and when we eventually got through she had already departed for a trip to the mountains - not a good idea soon after diving, especially when there were signs of DCI!  We eventually made contact again and monitored her situation. At altitude there was an increased discomfort in the area where the rash had been but fortunately nothing further developed. <br />
            <br />
          ****</p>
		  <p>After having such an unbelievable experience I couldn't  recommend more to divers that they take out<br /> 
		    DAN membership and insurance before  travelling overseas. It was the best money I have ever spent.<br /> 
		    <strong>If I hadn't taken  out DAN insurance I would be broke today. <br />

		    Dear John, I really appreciate your support. It's very reassuring to have someone such as you John to talk these things out with, tends to really put my mind at ease. I'm very grateful. Thanks again.

            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Background to case: </strong>Matt was in Japan. He had done two dives (31m and 21 m) with a surface interval of 1 hr 20 minutes. He was within his dive computer limits (as most cases of DCI are!) and there were no apparent problems during the dive. He awoke the next day with some numbness and tingling in one hand and foot. He was referred to a chamber in Tokyo and was treated successfully. </p>

            <p>****</p>
			<p> I cannot adequately express my gratitude for your support and professionalism in this matter. DAN is a truly world class organisation and will continue to get my full support.<br /> 
			  I appreciate your work on my behalf.
			<p><span class="sred"><strong> Peter, Australia </strong></span> </p>
			<p>****</p>
            <p> In a life/death scenario you don’t have time to play with. What I experienced with DAN was that there were no delays. Activation of a plan and decisions were immediate. I’ve rarely encountered this kind of efficiency and professionalism.</p>
			<p> <strong>Don’t risk going on a dive trip without DAN!</strong> With DAN from the moment you make that emergency or advice call, you’re instantly connected to a highly trained person, who assesses your call and transfers you to a doctor specialized in diving medicine. Within seconds you’re talking to a diving medical professional. If they’re not certain, they activate an immediate internal<br /> 
		    colleague-to-colleague collaboration.  </p>

            <p>Dear John, I would  like to express my gratitude at your assistance with my &ldquo;incident&rdquo; whilst in  the Maldives. It&rsquo;s nice to come across an organisation that actually lives up  to their guarantees and <br />
            promises. Your voice on the other end of the phone was comforting  in what was a strange <br />
            and slightly hostile environment. <br />
            <span class="sred">Wayne, Australia</span></p>
            <p>****</p>
            <p>John, many thanks&nbsp;for everything you and DAN did to help me through  my &quot;mishap&quot;.&nbsp; Your availability and advice&nbsp;was a great  relief to both myself and my family, certainly&nbsp;easing the stress and  concerns, and&nbsp;ensuring everything went smoothly and without problem.</p>
            <p class="strong">I hope I never need to have to use your services again<span class="em"> (I say this in  the nicest possible <br />
  way of course!!)</span>, however if I should, I am comfortable in  the knowledge that I know I <br />
            will be looked after and that your&nbsp;experience  and assistance will again see us<br /> 
            through without any issues.</p>

            <p>Dear John, once again I would like to express my true appreciation for your most professional and kind assistance while managing my diving accident in Bali. I could not imagine a better support in those difficult and 
            scary days.</p>
            <p>My Warmest Thanks!<br />
              <span class="sred">A.S., Australia </span></p>
            <p>****</p>
            <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank your organisation for the expert care, advice, assistance and support afforded me during my experience. I have only accolades for the manner in which you and your staff provided assistance.  Right from my first phone call I was treated courteously, supportively, professionally and promptly.   Most importantly your organisation was constantly in contact, checking my symptoms and giving advice and support over a period of some 18 hours.  I cannot tell you how reassuring it was given my remote location.   </p>
            <p>I again would like to thank you and your team of wonderful doctors and support staff at DAN.  <br />
            <span class="strong">It&rsquo;s no joke I owe you my life. </span></p>
            <p>You also need to know that I have become one of the greatest promoters of DAN you could possibly find.  I have badgered all my dive buddies, my dive club and anyone else I know that may be remotely involved in scuba diving to join DAN.<br />

            <p>****</p>
            <p>I want to  share my appreciation for all the help provided by Dick Clarke, Palmetto  Health Hyperbaric and John Lippmann, DAN Asia-Pacific regarding an  accident on May 15, 2007 at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.&nbsp; While  working as a dive instructor, I suffered major injuries in Australia while my  family was in the United States.&nbsp; With the help of Dick and John, my  family and I were able to reunite with minimal stress regarding travel logistics.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In addition, both Dick and John maintained contact throughout the six weeks  between the initial accident and transportation back to the States. </p>
            <p>John Lippmann was incredibly helpful and  someone I now consider a friend.&nbsp; Not only did John make sure things went  smoothly with my evacuation, but he also called frequently to check on my  progress.&nbsp;&nbsp; As complications occurred, John provided valuable  information with respect to Australian processes and procedures.&nbsp; In  addition, John provided local contacts and helped me get the best medical care  possible. </p>
            <p>I wanted to  share these experiences as well as express my gratitude to the DAN network,  Dick Clarke, and John Lippmann.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for all your hard work!<br />
              <span class="sred">Elizabeth, Raleigh NC</span></p>
            <p>****</p>
            <p>I cannot thank you enough for keeping my spirit high, encouraging me with your phone calls and organizing everything to bring me back to life.<br />

            <p>&quot;...  Recently I displayed symptoms of DCS after flying (after diving) and contacted  DAN. I wish to express my thanks to DAN for their prompt attention to this  matter. My calls were answered by courteous, professional staff, and dealt with  quickly. I also wish to express my sincere thanks to Mr. Lippmann for his  immediate accessibility and continued contact to follow up the status of the  matter. The response by DAN and Mr. Lippmann were exemplary. I have been aware  of DAN for some time, but only recently joined. I am extremely glad I did, and  will encourage <br />
            all divers I meet to join the organisation ...&quot;<br />
              <strong class="sred"><em>DAN  Member, Australia</em></strong></p>
            <p>****</p>
          <p>Thank you for your commitment and keep up the good work.<br />
            <span class="sred">Mark, Singapore</span></p>
          <p>****</p>
          <p>First may I say thank you very much for your concern and well  wishes whilst I was in hospital in Phuket, both Liam and I found it very  comforting to speak with someone who is so well versed in DCS, and you  certainly put our minds to rest. <br />
            <span class="sred">Laura, Singapore</span></p>
          <p>****<br />
            I can't express how wonderful DAN was&hellip;the follow-up was even  more impressive than the evacuation. John (Lippmann) has kept in touch and was  so kind and helpful to me when I was in hospital and then later when I had to  get my research equipment out of PNG. If it wasn't for the evacuation, it is  not sure that I would have survived, so how can I ever say enough thanks? <br />
            <span class="sred">Ingrid, New Zealand</span></p>
          <p>****</p>
          <p>I would like to thank you so much for your answer. It helped  me very much. I am really impressed with your Company and I would like to  reiterate my wishes to become one of your Members. Please do not hesitate to  contact me in case you go to Mexico  to dive or to Thailand! <br />
            <span class="sred">Laura, Thailand</span></p>
          <p>****</p>
          <p>Thanks  for your help last weekend. We wouldn't know what to do without your help.  Again, I am glad to be a DAN Member. Seems like many who patron my regular dive  shop agree with me now. <br />
