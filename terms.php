  <p><strong>DISCLOSURE</strong><br />
    Your duty of disclosure contracts of general insurance subject to the Insurance Contracts Act<br />
    Before you enter into a contract of general insurance with an insurer, you have a duty, under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, to disclose to the insurer every matter that you know, or could reasonably be expected to know, is relevant to the insurer's decision whether to accept the risk of the insurance and, if so, on what terms.<br />
    Your duty, however, does not require disclosure of matters: <br />
&bull;  that diminish the risk to be undertaken by the insurer,<br />
&bull;  that are of common knowledge, <br />
&bull;  that your insurer knows or, in the ordinary course of its business, ought to know, or <br />
&bull;  as to which compliance with your duty is waived by the insurer. <br />
    Non-Disclosure <br />
  If you fail to comply with your duty of disclosure, the insurer may be entitled to reduce its liability under the contract in respect of a claim, or may cancel the contract. If your non-disclosure is fraudulent, the insurer may also have the option of avoiding the contract from its beginning. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR DUTY APPLIES ALSO WHEN YOU AMEND, ALTER, VARY OR ENDORSE A POLICY. </p>
  <p><strong>UTMOST GOOD FAITH</strong><br />
  Every insurance contract is subject to the doctrine of utmost good faith, which requires that parties to the contract should act toward each other honestly and fairly, avoiding any attempt to deceive in assuming and performing contractual obligations. Failure to do so on the part of the insured may permit the insurer to refuse to pay a claim or to cancel the policy.</p>
