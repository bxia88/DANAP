<h1>Fast Process Option  For Membership</h1>
<p>Fast processing  means your application will normally (excluding payment/medical issues)  be processed within 24 hours from the time of receipt at the DAN  Asia-Pacific Office providing it is received during weekdays (before  2pm Friday). If received on a weekend or a public holiday (in  Melbourne, Australia) your application will be processed during the  next business day from the time of receipt at DAN Asia-Pacificâ€™s Head  Office.</p>
<p>There is no  evacuation or insurance cover whatsoever until payment has been cleared and DAN  has accepted the application.</p>
<p>Once  the membership application is accepted and registered, you will be  faxed or emailed your membership number as well as the contact numbers  to be used in an emergency. To this end, please ensure that you provide  us with your fax number or email address.</p>
<h4>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h4>
<p>Availability  of services and benefits for evacuation or injury commences on  acceptance of an application for membership of DAN Asia-Pacific. The  applicant is required to complete the application fully and in good  faith. No cover is provided for any evacuation, medical, paramedical or  other injury benefits resulting from or materially contributed to,  directly or indirectly by any diving or other activity in which the  applicant engaged prior to and up to the time of acceptance of the  application by DAN Asia-Pacific, regardless of the date on which any  claim for cover is made by or on behalf of the applicant.</p>
