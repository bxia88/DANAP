        <h1>I Didn't Want to Ruin My Dive Holiday - Incident Analysis </h1>
        <p><em>By  John Lippmann, DAN Asia-Pacific Founder, Chairman and Director of Research</em> </p>
        <p><strong>CASE  REPORT</strong><br />
          Emily (not her real name) is a healthy 39-year old  woman who was diving in Tulamben, Bali. She had completed a total of 49  lifetime dives, most of which had been shallow shore dives. Prior to this trip  she had not undertaken more than two dives in a day nor had she completed several  consecutive days of diving. She had no previous episode of decompression illness.  On this trip, Emily completed all dives on air, except Day 2 where the dives  were on nitrox with an air setting on her dive computer. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Day 1: Emily  completed the following three dives:</strong><br />
  <em>Dive 1:</em> 20m, total dive time (TDT) 54 mins, surface interval (SI) 1.5hrs.<br />
  <em>Dive 2:</em> 19m, TDT 65 mins, SI 2 hrs. <br />
  <em>Dive 3:</em> 22.8m, TDT 62 mins.</p>
        <p>That evening Emily felt slight pain that she  described more as pressure.&nbsp;She had some redness under her left breast  that she dismissed as wetsuit irritation. It disappeared overnight and she felt  fine the next morning.</p>
		
        <p><strong>Day 2:  Emily completed another three dives with the following profiles:</strong><br />
            <em>Dive 1:</em> 23.6m, TDT 61 mins, SI 1.5hrs. <br />
            <em>Dive 2:</em> 27.5m, TDT 48 mins, SI 2hrs.<br />
            <em>Dive 3:</em> 26.1m, TDT 51mins.</p>
        <p>During the second dive, Emily’s computer went into  deco so she ascended slowly and stayed at a shallower depth for the remainder of  the dive. Her computer remained in deco during dive 3 and she reported that alarms  and warnings sounded throughout the dive. She showed the divemaster who  indicated that his computer was still within limits and that she would be fine,  so they ascended slowly and made the usual safety stop.</p>
        <p>Immediately after this dive, Emily felt a pressure  like pain in both breasts and around her waist. She had a rash/bruising all  over her chest and some small patches on her torso and back.&nbsp;The rash on her  torso/back disappeared after a short time but remained on her chest for a few  hours. Her head felt foggy and she was very tired.&nbsp;She had complete loss  of appetite but forced fluids down. Whilst she was passing urine, she noticed that  her rate of urine output was minimal. </p>
		 <p align="center"><img src="_images/emily_rash2.jpg" width="170" height="215" /></p>
        <p><strong>Day 3:</strong> By the morning of Day 3 the rash had disappeared but Emily was worried  about it. She mentioned it to her dive group, but it was dismissed by the  others as a general skin irritation. She mentioned it to the dive guide who thought  it might be a bite and nothing to worry about. She didn’t discuss it further  and decided to complete only two dives. In between the dives she noticed the  rash again, which was painful. Immediately after dive 2, the diver had very  painful purple blotches all over her chest, which quickly turned pink, so it  looked like sunburn. Her head was very foggy and she still had no appetite.</p>
        <p><em>Dive 1:</em> 26m, TDT 52 mins, SI 2hrs. <br />
            <em>Dive 2:</em> 23.1m, TDT 51 mins.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Day 4</strong><br />
            <em>Dive 1:  26.9m, TDT 48 mins, SI 1hr.</em><br />
            <em>Dive 2:  SI: 1 hr, 21.4m, TDT 54 mins. </em></p>
        <p>On the fourth consecutive day of diving Emily  decided to complete only two dives as, despite feeling okay, she was still  concerned about the rash. Upon surfacing from the first dive the rash was  present and very painful. Dive 2 was to a site the diver didn’t want to miss  out on and, due to a scheduling issue, the surface interval was reduced to only  one hour. On completing this dive Emily knew she had a skin bend, and needed  advice, so she called John Lippmann at the Divers Alert Network (DAN). </p>
        <p>Upon DAN’s recommendation, Emily breathed O2  at the dive centre but she did so for only one hour then left against DAN’s  advice in order to make the three hour trip back to her hotel. Initially the  operator gave her nasal prongs, fortunately Emily remembered from having  completed the DAN Oxygen First Aid course that she needed a demand valve or non-re-breather  mask to receive a higher level of O2. She also knew to increase the  flowrate from the 4 litres per minute (lpm) it was on to 12 lpm with the non-re-breather  mask <em>(Ed Note: 10-15lpm is the  recommended oxygen flowrate for a non-re-breather mask).&nbsp;<br />
          </em><br />
          That night, the diver was in a lot of pain,  including pain between her shoulder blades and armpits.&nbsp;The following day  she felt clearer in the head but had a lot of swelling, especially in her legs.&nbsp;For  the next few days she felt awful.&nbsp;The diver  did not present at the Chamber as DAN recommended, nor did she breathe any more  O2. When asked why, Emily said: <u>“I didn’t want to ruin my  holiday!” </u></p>
        <p>On returning to Melbourne the swelling disappeared,  however Emily still experienced pain for two weeks and mental fogginess that  lasted a month. </p>
        <p>The diver has since undergone testing and been confirmed for  a PFO and an atrial septal aneurysm. <br />
            </p>
        <h2><strong>D</strong><strong>ISCUSSION</strong> </h2>
        <h5><em>Dive  Profiles</em></h5>
        <p>          Although not uncommon, the profiles completed  were certainly likely to have created significant bubbling in Emily’s body  tissues and blood. It is well known that nitrogen bubbles occur commonly after  many recreational dives, even within no-deco limits of dive computers and  tables. These bubbles are usually asymptomatic and are generally believed to be  harmless, being filtered out by the tiny blood vessels in the lungs. However, it  is wise to minimise the amount of bubbling and this is where conservative  diving practices such as shallower depth, reduced dive times, fewer dives, slow  ascents, safety stops and diving nitrox on air times can assist. It also takes  time for the bubbles to disappear and this is where extended surface intervals  can be beneficial.</p>
        <h5><em>Denial</em></h5>
        <p>The diver was suffering from a very good  dose of ‘Denial’, also very common: <em>I  can’t have DCI - I followed my computer – I’m on holidays and have other dives  to do and don’t want to miss them - it must be something else!</em> <br />
          <br />
        It was unfortunate that the dive  operator had never heard of a ‘skin bend’ (i.e. DCI involving the skin) and that  the diver’s friends didn’t consider that the rash could have been DCI as it made  it more difficult for Emily to accept there was a problem and act earlier. It’s  important the message gets out that a blotchy rash after diving should make one  suspect DCI and proper advice should be sought and acted upon. Although  skin-only symptoms can be relatively minor, there can also be more serious  symptoms associated with this, as in Emily’s case.</p>
        <h5><em>Ignoring Computer Warnings</em></h5>
        <p>          I was unimpressed that the dive guide  ignored the warning of the dive computer and appeared to assume that, if she  was diving within the limits of his computer, she was OK. This shows a real  lack of knowledge, and is unfortunately not that uncommon. </p>
        <h5><em>Assessment</em></h5>
        <p>When Emily described  her symptoms; I knew DCI was likely, so she needed good oxygen administration, likely  diving medical assessment and possibly treatment. On returning to her hotel in Sanur,  she had to travel over a mountain pass, and I was concerned that her symptoms  could increase with the altitude. I suggested that she breathe high  concentration oxygen for 3-4 hours before she began the journey. I offered to  arrange this but she was with her dive operator who had oxygen equipment and I  was assured that it was in hand. I also requested a ‘call-back’. When I hadn’t  heard back for a few hours I called and found out that Emily had only breathed  O2 for one hour. </p>
        <h5><em>O</em>2 <em>Delivery</em></h5>
        <p>          Initially, as the diver reported, the  delivery of O2 was far from ideal, with a flow ate  far too low to be effective, particularly for a diver who had chosen to receive  O2 first aid for only one hour. It’s  important that dive operators have suitable equipment and many hours of oxygen  supply to deal with such situations. Sometimes the equipment needs to go with  the diver to enable them to breathe oxygen on the way to the treatment facility  so a spare set and supply should be available in case it is needed by other  divers. </p>
        <h5><em>Ignoring DAN’s Advice</em></h5>
        <p>When the diver  informed me that she’d travelled over the mountain pass I suggested that I  could arrange for her to be assessed at the local chamber and advised this  would be prudent. However, she assured me she was OK and she’d let me know if  things worsened again. I called her the next day and she said she was feeling quite  well, despite an unsettled night. The dose of denial was still pretty strong! I  shouldn’t have believed her and more strongly asserted that she sought proper  assessment. It is likely that Emily would have benefited from recompression  treatment. </p>
        <h5><em>Skin Bend Recognition</em></h5>
        <p>          A red or bluish blotchy rash  (sometimes with underlying swelling) is a very common sign of DCI in a diver  with a PFO (Patent Foramen Ovale). Divers often put the rash down to a sting or  a wetsuit allergy or other skin irritation but, in my experience, it is far  more often DCI-related. So it wasn’t a surprise to hear that testing confirmed  Emily has a significant PFO. The previous diving she had done before this trip were  mainly shallow dives with fewer repetitive dives. The dives she’d done in Tulamben  were more aggressive and bubble-provoking. Emily now has to make a decision on  whether or not to restrict herself to very conservative diving, or to undergo  surgery – a difficult decision for most divers diagnosed with a PFO. </p>
