        <h1>Family Holiday in Malaysia  </h1>
        <p><em>Continued from the October Issue of Deeper with DAN</em>        </p>
        <p>Following  is the unedited report from the victim’s parents, who we thank for sharing  their story.</p>
        <h2>Tanjung Ruh Beach, Langkawi </h2>
        <p align="justify">Our  daughter Sally, aged 9, was stung late in the  afternoon one  day in May at the Tanjung Ruh Beach at Langkawi. It is at the north east side  of the island, not far from the mangrove forest. We  had been to that beach before, because of the good swimming conditions  according to tourist websites and documentation we received from the resort.  The sea wasn't very clear both days. We hadn't seen jellyfish.</p>
        <p align="justify">On  this day, our three children were standing in the sea about 5 metres out of the  beach. (Sally is 9 years old and about 1.50 meters tall) My husband and I were  still at the beach changing clothes. Our son said that he felt something bump  into his leg. It was the size of a ‘ping pong’ ball.  Only a few moments after that Sally felt like she walked into a sharp fishing  net and started screaming that she was in pain and she could not walk. </p>
        <p align="justify">My  husband ran into the sea and carried her out of it. At first, the stings were  white and they turned red almost immediately. We laid her on a towel and she  kept screaming that she was in severe pain and that she was going to die. Her  legs kept shaking extremely. We had no idea what could have happened, but a  local told us it must have been a jellyfish and we had to go to hospital  immediately.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>There were no  warning signs of the existence of jellyfish at all</strong>. My husband had to  carry Sally for a couple of hundred metres to a nearby resort. In the meantime,  someone had called the first aid and we were told to use vinegar or urine<em> (JL Note: urine is not effective!) </em>if  vinegar was not available. She was not allowed to eat or drink.&nbsp;Because we  had to wait for vinegar coming out of the resort kitchen, we used the urine of  our son first. Right after that we used the vinegar. It might have been about  10 minutes after the sting.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  locals thought it would take too long to wait for the ambulance so we were  brought to the government hospital in Kuah. During the 20-minute drive Sally  kept screaming that she was in pain and was going to die, that she had a  fantastic life and it wouldn’t be a problem if she died now. Her eyes were big  and rolling. She had difficulty breathing. I had to keep her with me by  slapping her cheeks. </p>
        <p align="justify">In  the hospital, they gave her antihistamine and painkillers. She started to shake  both of her arms and her head and had no control. She saw things that were not  there and she felt like there was hair sitting on her tongue all the time. She  was staring and concentrated on getting the hair off her tongue. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>We asked the doctor  there several times if this could have been a box jellyfish</strong>. <strong>He insisted that there are no dangerous  jellyfish in the Malaysian waters. </strong>He said that the shaking of her arms was  caused by her breathing problems and that I had to keep her calm and then her  arms would be still. <strong>After 5 hours at  the hospital, we were discharged with only some paracetamol. </strong>The doctor  told us that we could fly back to Kuala Lumpur the next day and travel back home.</p>
        <p align="justify">In  the hospital, we heard from locals that there has been a very nasty jellyfish  sting in April at Pantai Cenang Beach, which is at the west side of  Langkawi.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Back  in the hotel, Sally got more delirious. We didn’t have any sleep that  night.&nbsp; The next day , she was fit enough to travel  although she could not walk or stand up for more than a few minutes. She still  had the &quot;hair on her tongue&quot;. During the short flight she got more  pain and in the taxi to Kuala Lumpur she started vomiting. That was about 24  hours after the sting. </p>
        <p align="justify">As  she got sicker, we asked for a doctor late that night. He gave her a big shot  of antihistamine and some tablets for the vomiting. During the night, Sally was  restless. She couldn't lay down for more than a few minutes. She had a  headache, stomach ache, pain in her legs, her whole body actually. The next day , we were supposed to fly back to our home country in the late evening. During the day her  condition got worse and my husband searched the internet, because in a certain  way we did not believe the doctor in Kuah Hospital. Luckily, my husband found John  Lippmann’s article about the jellyfish in Malaysia. Now we knew we weren't some  overanxious parents, but that there was really something wrong! We called for  the doctor again and he contacted a hospital in  Kuala Lumpur. When the doctor saw Sally again, he told us she was certainly not  fit to fly and that he was worried about  her difficulty swallowing and the fact she was still vomiting.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">We  were brought to a private hospital. When we arrived, the doctor called the  National Poison Centre and told them about Sally's  complaints. The Poison Centre compared the symptoms with the effects of the  jellyfish. It did not take long to come to the conclusion that it must have  been a box jellyfish. The doctor told us this was the second time that they  treated a patient stung by a box jellyfish. There is no anti-venom in Malaysia <em>(JL Note: in any case box jellyfish anti-venom  needs to be given within about 20 minutes of being stung and needs to be  appropriate to the species involved)</em>. And because of the fact it was now 48  hours later, they had to try another way to help Sally.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">We  were brought to ICU because of Sally’s blood  pressure which was still rising. The doctor’s  told us that she was in danger. They were very clear of what could happen  having an “irukandji syndrome”. They were also afraid that the sepsis would not  stop.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Two  days later, the blood pressure was under control with medicines and she was  transferred to the children's ward. That night she had extreme pain in her  legs. It was awful! She wanted to have her legs cut off; she could walk on her  hands the rest of her life. After a shot of morphine and diazepam she calmed a  bit. After that night, she got hyper-sensitive, which was the last part of the  toxic effects, according the doctor. She could not bear the feeling of air on  her skin. She also had an infection behind her eyes.&nbsp;Basically, she has  had all the symptoms of the irukandji syndrome.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">After  10 days in hospital we could take Sally to the hotel again and, after 12 days,  we flew back home.&nbsp;The light shaking of her arms left  after about 4 weeks. Her legs are in pain in the evening, but it is not so  often anymore.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Sally  still has a headache every day, mostly in the evening. And she is still  restless and not feeling well. She becomes irritated quite quickly and is  afraid of insects, even if they are on drawings. We have sought help from a  psychologist, who calls this a post-traumatic stress syndrome.</p>
        <p align="justify">I  am glad that I have finally found a network to warn other people about the  jellyfish. I have tried some organisations in my country, but they could not do  anything based on just one case. We were very well-prepared for our journey to  Malaysia. It is not the first time we have visited Asia. There is still a  touristic website of Langkawi which writes that there are no jellyfish at all in  the sea at Langkawi. The touristic brochure we received said Tanjung Ruh is a  very nice beach to swim. There are no warning signs and there is no vinegar  available. And it is totally denied in the hospital. It gives us a very awkward  feeling. Actually, your article made us call for help at the right moment. We  are very grateful for that!&nbsp;</p>
        <h1><strong>Final Comment by DAN AP's John  Lippmann </strong></h1>
        <p align="justify">It  was disappointing and frustrating to receive the above email from a very  distressed parent again highlighting the lack of apparent improvement in the  prevention and management of severe jellyfish stings in Malaysia. </p>
        <p align="justify">We  should all be aware that various species of deadly and dangerous box jellyfish  are not uncommon in the waters of the Asia-Pacific. DAN AP is among a group who  have been collecting case reports and photographs of sighting throughout the  region to better track these.</p>
        <p align="justify">We  have received a lot of reports from Thailand and Malaysia, among other places.  There are always reports from northern Australia but, in Australia, tourists  are well-warned about the potential danger. There are highly visible warning  signs, vinegar posts on many beaches, emergency services and medical personnel  are well-trained and equipped to deal with stings and diving and snorkelling  operators often provide protective clothing. These strategies can and should serve  as a suitable model for other affected areas. </p>
        <p align="justify">We  have been working with some interested doctors and marine biologists in  Thailand who have been slowly but surely implementing some educational programs  there. A few resorts have set up vinegar stations for easy access, although  this is not yet widespread. There is a long way to go but there are some  outward signs that this is happening.</p>
        <p align="justify">Progress  has been slower in Malaysia but recently a group of doctors and scientists has  reformed as a starting point to address the problem. It is hoped that the  government will support the efforts of this group. The problem is relatively well-known  in certain hot-spots, such as Langkawi and Kota Kinabalu where there have been  several deaths and many severe stings, with many victims requiring hospital  care. </p>
        <p align="justify">However,  as shown clearly in this report, it appears that not enough has been done. As  in certain other places, there is likely a fear that highlighting the problem  will reduce tourism and, in the short term, it may. However, not addressing the  problem will likely have a greater effect. Word far more easily gets around on  the internet and in the media these days. The situation in Australia highlights  how the problem can be well-managed in order to minimise any impact on tourist  numbers and create appropriate awareness and confidence that the visitor’s  well-being is a priority.</p>
