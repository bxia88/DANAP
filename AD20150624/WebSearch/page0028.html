LIFE AQUATIC Sweet Siren Smells of Coral and Seawed The olfactory allure of healthy marine ecosystems By Naomi Lubick Perfume is meant to allure — and healthy coral reefs and certain beneficial species of seaweed use sweet smells to entice young fish and baby corals. A healthy reef sends out attractive scents, broadcasting underwater like a siren to lure the young that will be the next generation of reef builders and dwellers. According to experiments by coral biologist Danielle Dixson of the Georgia Institute of Technology and her colleagues, biochemical signatures indicate whether a reef is healthy and would make a good place to settle down. Dixson’s team experimented with coral and seaweed species offshore in Fiji, near marine protected areas as well as areas open to fishing. The team gardened underwater plots in the area, pruning some to be skewed toward algal mats and nasty seaweed species, while enabling others to be more natural or even healthier. They tracked where coral and seaweed settled in the offshore plots and transects, and they counted the fish present in different areas. Fish appeared several times more often in healthier reef settings, and they avoided reefs smothered by noxious seaweed. The researchers also conducted a series of experiments in the lab to determine what would happen in simplified systems compared to their real-world experiments. They placed young fish and coral larvae into flumes spiked with good or bad scents. Invariably, both young fish and corals would head for the sweeter smells — even fighting currents to do so, the team recently reported in the journal Science. “The thing that most shocked us was not that they could smell a good reef from a bad reef,” said Dixson’s co-author Mark Hay, a marine ecologist at Georgia Tech,“Nor that fish could swim away to wherever they wanted (usually to nearby marine protected areas, where the “ The thing that most shocked us was not that they could smell a good reef from a bad reef... But coral larvae are tiny saclike creatures that can barely swim, and here they were heading towards the good smells... contending with é Healthy reefs give off scents that attract young fish, as well as coral (and other) larvae 28 waves crashing around them... ”
