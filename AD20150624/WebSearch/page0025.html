compounds. Moving further afield, archaeology has a strong presence underwater, both for shipwreck and submerged terrestrial site studies. Speleology and hydrology incorporate a great deal of diving for the study of caves and water. Many other scientific fields also have a presence. retained by the scientist-diver, and it is relatively é Hand coring by scientific rare for dives to be necessary in conditions that divers has been shown to give highly accurate samples for a offer a less-than-comfortable margin beyond range of research disciplines acceptable. This reality is far different from that of some commercial and military operations. The supervision of scientific diving operations also provides a safety net not matched in most recreational diving activities. LEADERSHIP Many scientists come to diving primarily as a means to advance their science. Some continue to use it as simply another tool to facilitate their work. Others may more fully embrace the diving, and even gravitate to a greater focus on the diving and diving safety than the science. The latter group may provide the best pool of potential diving officers, the individuals “What is interesting, given this remarkable range, is the strong record of scientific diving safety.” Scientific diving is conducted both shallow and deep, under ice, and far back in caves, in pretty much any situation in which creative scientists can access water. What is interesting, given this remarkable range, is the strong record of scientific diving safety. A recent review of 10 years of scientific diving conducted by organisational members of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS), a US-based association with membership primarily comprised of institutions with scientific diving programs, captured over one million dives with a very small number of accidents. The sample included 33 cases of decompression illness (DCI) — the collective term for decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism — for a DCI incidence rate of 0.324 per 10,000 person-dives. While the data for other forms of diving are incomplete, DCS estimates range from 0.9 to 35.3 per 10,000 person-dives. There are likely a number of reasons for the relatively good safety record of scientific diving. Most of the standards followed have evolved from years of thoughtful experience in a community, the choice of dive sites is usually
