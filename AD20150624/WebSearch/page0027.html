è Standardised photoquadrat methods are used in the quantification of ecosystem change officer, and probably the most enjoyable approach, is to join research teams in the field. Field evaluations can be effective when offered as a convenience to the dive team. One method is for the diving officer to volunteer to assist with normal operations on the day for the small price of having the team participate in skill evaluations at the end. The diving officer assists with regular activities to keep the day productive while quietly evaluating normal operations of the team. This provides insights into crew performance and the needs of the scientific work. As an additional benefit, the time can also refresh some skills that the diving officer does not use on a daily basis, a useful element since the one providing oversight can sometimes be independent of the same protection. Running drills and emergency simulations at the end of the working day provides a better sense of performance with a normal degree of fatigue. Less-than-stellar performance under realistic conditions is more likely to capture the attention of a diver or dive team — it is more difficult to ignore problems evident in a normal day than a simulated one. The completion of field evaluation days is often extremely satisfying. The cost, particularly for diving officers working in environmental health and safety offices with staff from multiple disciplines, is that it is hard for colleagues to resist a niggling (or greater) sense that these are wasted days. The best way to combat that is to have at least one other safety officer with some dive training to participate in one of the field evaluations. My favourite day of this type was when a fit — but minimally experienced with diving — safety officer who had agreed to be cross-trained declared in a staff meeting that the “wasted” day constituted the hardest work he had experienced in his career as a safety officer. It would, of course, have become much easier as he gained experience, but when part of the office time you have to justify is in the ocean, it is sometimes best to promote a few illusions. A good way to investigate potential careers in diving health and safety is to join an existing scientific diving programme. While this may be easiest for students at institutions with programme, non-students may also be able to join, often initially as volunteer divers. This can be the gateway, providing experience and training and, if the fit is good, more opportunity. Those who enjoy the challenge of holding all of the pieces together to maintain a safe diving programme could find a very satisfying career path.
