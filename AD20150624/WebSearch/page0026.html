“Diving officers, like other safety professionals, are in the position that if they do their jobs well, they help ensure that nothing, or rather nothing untoward, happens.” navigate the challenges to ensure that divers are appropriately trained, making good decisions, submitting necessary documentation and retaining their currency — all to meet standards and avoid accidents. Diving officers, like other safety professionals, are in the position that if they do their jobs well, they help ensure that nothing, or rather nothing untoward, happens. All the critical assessment, planning, training, monitoring and anticipation establishes an umbrella of protection. A good diving programme will have a culture of thoughtfulness, low stress and safe operations with great institutional support. Each of these aspects is necessary for a programme to flourish over time. EVALUATION The evaluation of scientific diver competency can be an interesting challenge. Working scientists are busy, often disliking mandates to disrupt their activities for pool or classroom sessions. More importantly, such sessions are unlikely to represent the normal working conditions of the dive team. Artificial conditions are less effective at testing divers’ true capabilities, and the diving officer misses the opportunity to see the specifics of operations that are impossible to assess in summary documentation or highly constrained scenarios. The most effective strategy of a good diving responsible for the day-to-day administration of all divers and projects in the scientific diving programme. The experience of appreciating the scientific approach, knowing how scientists think, what they need to achieve their ends, and, often most importantly, how to reconcile the scientific motivation with training and safety needs, is a powerful capability. Should mission creep ever lead scientific divers toward questionable decisions, the diving officer (who often trains and certainly monitors and periodically evaluates the programme’s divers) stands by as a conscience to remind everyone of the priority of safety. Diving officers generally work under the oversight of a diving control board (DCB), a panel normally made up of senior diving scientists and institutional representatives such as a medical officer. While the DCB can direct events, it is typically the diving officer who has the greatest impact on the character and operation of the programme.
