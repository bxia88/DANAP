Decompression illness in the Asia-Pacific in 2013 as reported to DAN Asia-Pacific By John Lippmann 400 344 350 300 250 200 146 150 100 67 50 29 26 20 18 11 5 4 4 2 1 2 0 Korea Singapore New Zealand Hong Kong Indonesia Chuuk Vanuatu Philippines China Solomon Islands Thailand Fiji Australia Malaysia tourists diving on the Great Barrier Reef. There is a lot of readily available information about DCI recognition, and the dive industry is quite well educated about this. The chambers are many, accessible and cost-free to locals so the number of cases treated is relatively high, compared to places like Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, which also have high diving activity. Decompression illness (DCI) is an ever-present risk in diving but fortunately is not a common event. However, each year a number of divers suffer from symptoms of DCI. Sometimes it is easy to understand why a diver developed symptoms by looking at his or her dive profile(s). However, in most cases, the divers had been diving within the limits of the computers, algorithms or tables and still got DCI. Sometimes this can be related back to the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO); other times to factors such as exertion, cold or dehydration; while on other occasions there is no obvious reason. Once again the data from South Korea appear to be disproportionately high compared with the diving activity. This may indicate a safety issue for Korean divers, a low threshold for treatment in certain chambers, and/or possibly an issue with the reporting of the information. DAN Asia-Pacific has received reports of a total of 679 recreational divers being treated for DCI in the region in 2013. This is based on reports received from the major chambers. However, there are some small chambers in certain countries that treat divers from time to time but from which we receive no report. 35 30 2013 Asia-Pacific Dive-related Deaths 25 The reality is that it is likely that quite a lot of divers who do suffer DCI do not present for recompression treatment. This is often because they do not recognise the symptoms or are in denial about them. It might also be that the symptoms have cleared with oxygen first aid, or with time. 20 SCUBA (39) REBREATHER (0) SURFACE SUPPLY (1) BREATH HOLD (28) UNKNOWN (0) TOTAL 15 10 In some countries, the dive community is 5 better educated about DCI and chambers are very accessible. This leads to more divers presenting for treatment.
