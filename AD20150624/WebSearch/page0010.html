food. They take them back to their chicks, which ingest them and perish from gastrointestinal blockage and, ultimately, starvation.” During the final two days we visited an isolated area called Hallo Bay, which is part of Katmai National Park. Hallo Bay is a remote area, but it received an influx of debris from the 2011 Japanese tsunami. It’s also famous for grizzly bears — park biologists estimate that some 2,200 live in Katmai. Before we arrived, Katmai rangers had collected more than 1,800 kilograms of trash from the dunes and beach. Some of this garbage had been chewed on by bears. According to park superintendent Diane Chung, “Bears are very fascinated by the marine debris, especially plastic floats. Although we haven’t documented any deaths, we are concerned about the bears being exposed not only to the plastics but also to the toxins such as lead that often coat these items.”é The project hauled out tons of the kind of plastic garbage that is responsible for killing vast numbers of marine creatures Our visit to Hallo Bay was timed to remove Slowly the bears walked away and we were this trash and take it back to Seward. It took our team nearly 13 hours to load everything with the park service, which left only one day to explore this beautiful area. Until then we had only seen bears from a distance, but Hallo Bay delivered the encounter with a mother and her curious cubs that none of us would ever forget. left in astonished silence. It was incredibly moving, and some people were even weeping. I had never planned on coming face to face with a grizzly during my trip to Alaska, but encounters like this one change people and remind why we protect wild places. They also motivate us to get involved — for the sake of the sea life, the bears and our own legacy on this planet. ê Meaningful encounters with creatures like these bears in Anchorage are an emotional reminder of the importance of changing our consumption of plastic 10
