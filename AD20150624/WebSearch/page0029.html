at the University of Maine: “If you just protect parrotfish [and other fish species that eat noxious seaweed], they can create a much more attractive nursery habitat, for both fish and coral young. The study provides interesting feedback that we need if we are going to manage these reefs into the next century.” living is easy). But coral larvae are tiny saclike creatures that can barely swim, and here they were, heading toward the good smells in the flumes and most likely in the real world too, while contending with waves crashing around them, big enough that they were pushing us [humans] off the reef.” Because the larvae can make a beeline to settle near sweeter-smelling healthy corals, they are much more in control of their survival than one might think, Hay said: “They glue themselves to the bottom, and that one choice that they make as a baby has so much impact on [their] future well-being.”é Planting coral gardens full of healthy coral colonies that give off a pleasant “odour” could serve to attract reef-dwelling and reef-building species ê Failure for reefs to recover has been shown to be partly due to the ways in which polluted, algae-smothered reefs deter new recruits with scents that broadcast their demise The next steps are to test that idea. Dixson and her team plan to train fishermen in Fiji to act like perfume purveyors: They could plant and tend to sweet-smelling coral and see if young fish and corals will come. These behavioural insights also hint at one reason why reefs are in decline worldwide, according to Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, who commented on the research by email. “Often researchers ask the question ‘What killed the corals?’ when confronted with a decline in coral cover. This novel study shows convincingly that loss of corals, and [their] failure to recover, can also be linked to reproduction and settlement of larvae.” Because both fish and corals avoid polluted, seaweed-smothered reefs, that could lead to their further decline. Could these sweet scents help protect coral reefs? The new results may lead to a simple solution, said Robert Steneck, a marine ecologist
