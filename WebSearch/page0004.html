FROM THE SAFETY STOP PERSPECTIVES Getting the care you need, when you need it • DAN’s sole focus is diving medicine and diving safety — that’s all we do. • When divers call one of our 24/7 hotlines they speak to medical staff with specialised knowledge of dive injuries, and who know how to handle diving emergencies correctly and immediately. • DAN reinvests its funds into research and efforts to improve the health and safety of diving throughout the Asia-Pacific region. • DAN Asia-Pacific is the only non-profit organisation dedicated to dive safety in the Asia-Pacific region. • And, last but not least, when divers have DAN Membership with DAN insurance, our emergency medical staff can easily look them up, verify their coverage and begin needed care, right away – which is not always the case when divers have other insurance – an important point to remember when considering which insurance will serve you best and most quickly, in a real dive emergency. Divers Alert Network (DAN) Asia-Pacific has more than 20 years of experience helping sick and injured divers. With our affiliated International DAN organisations across the globe we have assisted thousands of divers worldwide. From all that experience comes a level of expertise that divers rely upon and trust. That’s why the 300,000-plus DAN members worldwide dive with peace of mind. These divers we help value DAN as the experts in dive accident management. Here are some words from a few of our respected members: “I’ve dived for 10 years and completed 680 dives, and I never thought I would have DCI, but I did. I hope you are covered by DAN, so you, too, will have someone to count on in the very possible event of a scuba diving incident. DAN was of great help from the moment they received the call about my condition; their professionalism and care was so efficient and touching.” -Seung Hee, Korea To all our current members, thank you for your “My wife and I are eternally grateful for the amazing support we received from DAN. I had no idea how stressful an incident would be on my partner and me. Next time you think that you don’t need DAN coverage, think twice!” support. If you are not yet a DAN member, we look forward to welcoming you to DAN. Safe Diving, Chris Wachholz, CEO -Dirk, Australia There are many factors that distinguish our organisation from others and reaffirm DAN’s level of expertise: Engage with DAN on Facebook è The DAN Asia-Pacific team 4
