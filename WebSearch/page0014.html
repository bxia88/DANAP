OXYGEN AND DAN MEMBERSHIP: ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT This incident gave me and my dive buddies a real wake-up call. We all dive this area on a regular basis and quite often to 40 metres. My experience goes to show that even when you follow your dive computer, and even when you use a conservative setting, you can still get hit with DCI. Prior to both dives I was fully hydrated and well rested, and I hadn’t consumed any alcohol for more than seven days. é The Solomon Islands are famous for their WWII wrecks 1. I now make sure that I take extended surface intervals between dives. 2. Knowing how effective oxygen first aid is, we now carry oxygen with us to avoid any delays in access should my buddies or I ever need it. Having a DAN doctor on the other end of the line was very reassuring, especially when I was told I wouldn’t need a second treatment. The doctor examined my profiles for the two days and suggested my “hit” was simply a matter of odds. I was amazed at just how fast the onset of paralysis set in after I surfaced, and I was even more surprised by how fast it subsided with oxygen first aid. I was also pleasantly surprised when I received two follow-up calls from DAN just to see how I was — what a professional service. The only modification I might make in In my opinion, anybody who dives and does retrospect would be to extend the surface interval a bit. Fortunately I have received the “all clear” from my doctor (who has training in dive medicine) and am diving again. Since returning to the water I have made two changes: not have DAN membership and insurance is foolish. Bad luck can happen to anybody, so it pays to be prepared. “ I was amazed at just how fast the onset of paralysis set in after I surfaced, and I was even more surprised by how fast it subsided with oxygen first aid. ” COMMENT FROM DAN ASIA-PACIFIC’S JOHN LIPPMANN This was a great outcome for Rob and so easily could have been far worse. I think he has gained some valuable insights, and his suggestions of how he can try to avoid a similar problem in the future seem sound to me. 14
