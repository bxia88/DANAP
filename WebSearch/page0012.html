RESEARCH, EDUCATION & MEDICINE DAN WAS THERE FOR ME Paralysis in the Solomon Islands A wake-up call for one unlucky diver reveals the importance of oxygen therapy Text by DAN Asia-Pacific member Rob Duckworth Images by Stephen Frink than 50 times, so I know it well. The depth of this site ranges from seven metres at the bow to approximately 56 metres at the stern. We often dive to 40 to 48 metres on this wreck without any problems. The water temperature at 40 metres is between 28°C to 31°C, the visibility is typically excellent and the current minimal. As someone who lives and works in the Solomon Islands I consider myself lucky that I am able to dive most weeks. The norm for me is conducting two dives every Saturday and Sunday. I am a 57-year-old male and consider myself relatively fit and healthy, and I have done around 550 dives to date with no prior encounters with decompression illness (DCI). FAMILIAR DIVE, CONSERVATIVE PROFILE One day, two friends and I were heading out for two shore dives at Mbonegi-1, which is a 25-minute drive west of Honiara. To date, I have dived this World War II Japanese shipwreck more Our first dive was for 42 minutes to a depth of 40 metres. After a surface interval of 75 minutes, we completed a second dive to 42.4 metres for a total dive time of 50 minutes. Time spent at the maximum depth was only a few seconds on both dives as we cruised through a break in the cargo hold of the ship and then commenced our return to the surface. ê Divers in remote areas such as the Solomon Islands should be especially conscientious about having an emergency plan and enough oxygen to get an injured diver to professional medical care 12
