RESEARCH, EDUCATION & MEDICINE SAFETY 101 Three Common Mistakes in Providing Oxygen First Aid By John Lippmann with contributions from Stan Bugg Images by Stephen Frink DAN Asia-Pacific Members are by now familiar with our current safety campaign to reinforce the need for trained oxygen providers and suitable oxygen equipment at every dive site. For the management of decompression illness (DCI), oxygen is the first aid of choice, and the sooner it is provided, the better. Along with DAN Asia-Pacific — which has trained more than 38,000 oxygen providers — diver certification agencies, first aid associations and lifesaving organisations offer oxygen first aid training. The level of training offered varies among agencies and individual trainers. As with most training, students must employ repetitive practice to first understand, then learn and finally embed the required skills so that they enter long-term memory and become automatic. Therefore, the more hands-on practice a training course provides, the more likely it is that the course will prove successful. It is important for oxygen providers to continue to refresh their skills as often as possible after their training course ends, if only by a brief “play” with the equipment. After more than 30 years of teaching oxygen first aid and 22 years of fielding diving emergency calls, I’ve seen and heard about a broad range of errors made by oxygen providers; here I will highlight three of the most common. ERROR 1: INADEQUATE EQUIPMENT Every diver’s oxygen unit should include: • a suitable and well-functioning demand valve that can provide a high concentration of oxygen to a breathing diver; • a non-rebreather mask fitted with three one-way valves for use with a breathing diver; • a resuscitation mask for rescue breathing during CPR; • a supply of oxygen sufficient to last until a doctor trained in dive medicine advises that oxygen first aid should stop or until an alternative oxygen supply is available. Unfortunately, inadequate and poorly maintained equipment is common, especially in remote locations. I’ve seen many units in the field that are in poor condition or are missing components. For example, I’ve seen absent and poorly functioning demand valves. If the breathing resistance of a demand valves is too high, it will
