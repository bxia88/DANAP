I was relishing the opportunity to explore this remote territory — not only with my camera but also with an incredible group of people. Gyre’s participants included scientists, filmmakers, a teacher and artists, and all shared the same mission: to highlight the striking contrast between the rugged beauty of Alaska and the thousands of tons of trash that are spat out of the North Pacific Gyre onto Alaskan beaches each year. From February through September, 2014, the Anchorage Museum is featuring an exhibit called “Gyre: The Plastic Ocean”, which presents works of art made from garbage collected during the expedition. Artist Pam Longobardi collected scores of fishing floats, which are now part of her installation at the exhibit. Said Longobardi, “Plastics are the cultural archaeology of our time. They don’t belong in the ocean, and the tremendous, conscious force of energy that is the ocean does everything it can to expel this material and vomit it back onto the beach to show us the wrong we have done.”éê The rugged beauty of Alaska is a stark contrast to the thousands of tons of trash that wash up on its beaches, spewed out by the Pacific Gyre After a week at sea we had visited nearly a dozen locations including Gore Point, Point Blank, Shuyak Island and Afognak. Along the way, Ocean Conservancy biologist Nick Mallos collected 831 brightly coloured bottle caps, more than half of which originated on the other side of the Pacific. According to Mallos, “Seabirds like albatrosses often mistake plastic bottle caps for “Packing straps account for 50 percent of Stellar sea lion entanglements. A strap slowly sawing its way into the neck is a horrific way to die.” Most of our days were spent on isolated beaches that can only be reached by floatplane or small boat. Some were expansive and contained thousands of massive logs. Others were tiny and contained no logs at all. We found debris ranging from huge fishing nets to plastic bottles from Japan. On one beach we found hundreds of college football flyswatters destined for fans across the U.S. On another we came across a massive ball of packing straps. In Alaskan waters, packing straps account for 50 percent of Steller sea lion entanglements. A strap slowly sawing its way into the neck is a horrific way to die.
