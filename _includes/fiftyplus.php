<p class="f12" align="justify">DAN and other fatality data show that divers over about 45 years old have a substantially increased risk of death while diving. Many of these result from cardiac-related problems that were precipitated by the cardiac stressors in the diving environment (e.g., exertion, immersion, wearing heavy and restrictive equipment, breathing denser gas at increased partial pressures, among others). These incidents often occur in divers who were unaware of any pre-existing problems.  <a rel="popup standard 670 600 noicon" href="http://www.danasiapacific.org/main/popups/fiftyplus.php" title=" [Opens in pop-up window]">CLICK HERE</a> to read one Member's story about how DAN's request for further medical information may have saved his life.</p>

<p class="f12" align="justify">DAN AP encourages divers over about 50 to visit a doctor, preferably one trained in diving medicine (who should be more aware of the stressors of the diving environment), to discuss their diving and health and determine whether any particular testing is advisable. (Often a good medical history and examination will suffice. However, sometimes an exercise stress test and/or an ultrasound of the heart may also be appropriate).</p>
 
<p class="f12" align="justify">We recommend that such medical assessments be done at least every two years, or earlier if there is a substantial change in health.  </p>
