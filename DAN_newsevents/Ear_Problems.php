	      <h1>Rise in Cases of Severe Ear Problems </h1>
	      <p><em>By John Lippmann, DAN Asia-Pacific Executive Director </em></p>
	      <p align="justify">Although ear injuries commonly result from diving, especially with novices, historically, DAN AP  has had relatively few Members who sustained such injuries. However, this  appears to be changing and DAN is now receiving an increasing  number of reports of divers with serious ear injuries. Following are some recent case examples:</p>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>Case 1</strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify">This 51-year-old male is a divemaster with a history  of around 500 dives. He conducted a single 22m dive during which he had no  noticeable equalisation problems, although at one point he mentioned pushing a  finger under his hood to allow water entry. On surfacing and removing his hood  he noticed an echo in one ear, muffled hearing, a buzzing noise, and very  slight dizziness. He went to a general doctor several hours later and was given  decongestants. Still rightly concerned, he consulted a specialist two days  later and various tests were conducted. However, by the time the diagnosis of  inner ear barotraumas (IEBT) was made, he sustained permanent severe hearing  loss and tinnitus in the affected ear.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>Case 2</strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify"> A 34-year-old  technical diver had completed two deco dives and surfaced with &ldquo;a feeling of  fullness in his ears and sinuses&rdquo;. Back on the boat when later he forcefully  equalised his ears (valsalva), he heard a loud popping and felt sudden  dizziness and complete hearing loss in one ear. Believing this not to be  serious, he did not call DAN and remained on the boat for the next 3 days, not  diving but with persistent hearing loss and dizziness. On returning to  Singapore, he contacted DAN and was directed to a nearby hospital with an Ear  Nose and Throat Specialist. A diagnosis of IEBT was made and he remained in  hospital for a week. He spent several weeks convalescing. The dizziness cleared up, however the damage to the ear was irreversible and he was left with  permanent hearing loss and ringing (tinnitus) in one ear.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>Case 3</strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify">While  on a diving vacation in the Solomons, this 51- year-old diver with a history of  more than 3000 dives noticed a full feeling in one ear, dizziness and hearing  loss while boarding the boat after the second of two 50-60m decompression stop  dives. He reported that he had no equalization difficulties. Believing that he  had an ear infection, he self-medicated with antibiotics and did another three  dives. After flying home, he contacted DAN some 5 days after the injury and was  referred to an ENT specialist after discussion with a hyperbaric doctor. He was  diagnosed with IEBT. By this time, irreversible damage was done and he is left  with profound hearing loss and tinnitus in one ear.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify"><strong>Case 4</strong> </h2>
	      <p align="justify">This diver had done 30 dives over two weeks in  Indonesia to a maximum depth of 23m. Despite suffering severe diarrhoea, he  decided to continue diving, although likely to still be dehydrated. On the  final day he did 3 dives with no reported equalisation or other problems. However,  about 1.5 hours after surfacing, and while having a hot shower, he suddenly  suffered severe vertigo (spinning), accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He was  taken to the local navy chamber and he was already inside and receiving  treatment by the time DAN was called. The chamber was small and it was very hot  inside and he continued to vomit continuously. He became very distressed and  later said that he thought he was going to die in there. DAN arranged to  evacuate him to Singapore where he was diagnosed with inner ear decompression  illness and received several more recompression treatments. Fortunately, his  symptoms improved greatly. </p>
	      <h2 align="justify">Ear Barotrauma: An Insight </h2>
	      <p align="justify">One of the first skills divers learn is how to  &ldquo;equalise&rdquo; their ears. Failure to adequately equalise the ears results in ear  barotrauma (pressure injury). This is often apparent by a feeling of pressure,  soon followed by pain, during descent (or sometimes ascent).</p>
	      <p align="justify">The most common  and usually the most effective method of equalising involves the diver holding  his/her nose and blowing gently. This is known as the &ldquo;Valsalva Manouvre&rdquo;.  Although this method is very effective, damage can occur if it is done too  vigorously. Overly-forceful equalisation should be avoided. Other methods  include swallowing (with or without the nose blocked), wriggling the jaw,  squeezing the tongue against the soft palate, or a combination of these. Divers  need to ensure that whatever technique they use is effective in preventing  pressure build-up.</p>
	      <p align="justify">If the pressure is  not equalised, swelling and bleeding of the lining withing the ear will occur,  which 
	        helps to equalise  the pressures and relieve the pain, although this can often lead to infection.  In some cases the eardrum can rupture and, in very severe cases, delicate  membranes within the inner ear can tear, enabling fluid to leak from the inner  ear and creating the potential to damage this delicate organ, possibly  affecting hearing and balance. </p>
	      <p align="justify">Bubbles from  decompression can also form in or around the inner ear and so disrupt its  function - inner ear decompression illness. In addition, a variety of other  non-diving-related conditions affecting the ear can cause symptoms in divers  during or after a dive.</p>
	      <p align="justify">Signs and symptoms associated with inner  ear dysfunction may include hearing loss, vertigo (spinning), dizziness,  ringing or other ear sounds (tinnitus), nausea and vomiting.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify">Quick Action is Paramount </h2>
	      <p align="justify">Any diver with  these signs or symptoms after diving should promptly call a DAN-supported  diving emergency hotline for advice. The doctor or medic will take a thorough  history including the dive profile, the mode of equalisation and any  equalisation issues, and the time of onset and progression of symptoms. A  suitable course of action will then be determined.</p>
	      <p align="justify">An inner ear  barotrauma or decompression illness needs to be managed swiftly and  appropriately to minimise the potential for permanent injury. </p>
	      <p align="justify">Although it can sometimes be very difficult to differentiate between inner ear  barotrauma, decompression illness, and certain other disorders, a specialist  can make a provisional diagnosis and advise the best course of action based on  the likely problems and the severity of the symptoms. Sometimes permanent  injury may be unavoidable but on other occasions, quick action can minimise the  likelihood of permanent hearing or balance problems.</p>
	      <h2 align="justify">Thank You DAN</h2>
	      <p align="justify">One of the above Member's  assisted by DAN sent the following: </p>
	      <p align="justify"><em>Thank you so much for the support  DAN has shown me throughout this whole incident. I always heard DAN was good, and I hoped I would never have to find out if that was true for  myself, but you really have been phenomenal. DAN membership must be some of the  best money I have ever spent in my life. Regardless if I ever become dive fit  again, I will always remain a member of DAN, and proud to be associated with  such a great organisation.</em> </p>
