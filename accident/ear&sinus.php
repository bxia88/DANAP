          <h1>Ear and Sinus Injuries</h1>
          <p class="emstrong">This is meant as a  general overview and should not be used in place of a medical consultation</p>
          <h2>Learning to Adapt</h2>
          <p> As divers, we must adapt to an environment that exerts  pressure on our bodies. The most common injuries reported to DAN each year  involve pressure related injuries to divers&rsquo; ears and sinuses. A little  education and common sense will go a long way to avoid these problems.</p>
          <h2>            Sinus and Middle Ear Injuries</h2>
          <p> Barotrauma is a pressure related injury. Middle ear  barotrauma, known as &ldquo;ear squeeze&rdquo;, is the most common diving injury. Sinus  barotrauma also occurs but is less common. How does it happen? Barotrauma is  caused by pressure changes when diving. During descent, air spaces in the  sinuses and middle ear must be able to equalise to the surrounding water  pressure, which increases with depth. When pressure in air spaces can&rsquo;t  equalise, the diver may sense pressure or pain from one of these areas. During  ascent, if the expanding air can&rsquo;t be vented, the cavity pressure increases,  resulting in discomfort. This type of injury can range in severity - from mild  to extreme. A sinus or middle ear injury may occur suddenly and lead to inner  ear damage. For this reason, divers should know and use the &ldquo;clearing&rdquo; or  equalising maneuver that works best for them.</p>
          <h2>            How to Equalise</h2>
          <p> The Valsalva Maneuver is probably the most commonly  taught means of equalising pressure where the diver closes the mouth, pinches  the nose and blows gently. Avoid blowing too hard and over-inflating the middle  ear space. The result could be injury to the middle or inner ear. The Frenzel  Maneuver is similar to the Valsalva except that instead of blowing air into the  sinuses, the diver closes the nose and mouth, and drives the tongue backwards  on the roof of the mouth. The muscle contraction opens the nasal cavities and  Eustachian tubes, which allows air into the middle ear. The Yawn &amp; Swallow.  Some divers can simply yawn, swallow or thrust the lower jaw forward and open  the mouth while using the lips to maintain a seal with the regulator  mouthpiece. This opens the Eustachian tube to the middle ear, which equalises  pressure. As long as the sinuses also equalise easily, this maneuver is  acceptable. For many divers, a combination of these methods - even switching  back and forth during a single descent - works best.</p>
          <h2>            Prevention is the Key</h2>
          <p> The most common reason divers suffer barotrauma is a failure  to inflate the ears and sinuses with additional air during descent. Often  divers mistakenly wait to equalise their ears or sinuses when they feel  discomfort. Begin the equalising process by inflating your ears and sinuses  with air before entering the water or beginning your descent - this ensures  that the air passages are open and clearing is possible. A slow, steady descent  with frequent inflation is then possible without barotrauma. If you feel  discomfort, stop your descent and ascend about a metre until the discomfort is  relieved. Attempt to clear but do not continue your descent unless your sinus  and middle ear spaces have equalised.</p>
          <h2> Difficulty Equalising</h2>
          <p> What if you can&rsquo;t equalise? First, don&rsquo;t dive until the  problem is resolved. If a diver has trouble equalising the sinuses and middle  ear, there may be some pre-existing problem - the most common is diving with a  cold or flu. Frequently the mucous membrane will retain fluid and swell,  partially occluding the air passages to your sinuses and the Eustachian tube  going from the back of your throat to the middle ear. This not only makes  clearing difficult, but it may prevent diving altogether. Other recognisable  factors in equalising problems are a history of childhood ear infections (or  even one severe infection) that can damage the tubes, a history of a broken  nose or a deviated septum that prevents one ear or a set of sinuses from  clearing as fast as the opposite side, or hay fever which can produce swelling  of the mucous membranes or cause nasal polyps that can partially or completely  occlude a sinus cavity or airway. If you have a history that includes these  conditions and want to dive successfully, it may require referral to an ear,  nose and throat specialist or allergy specialist who is familiar with these  conditions.</p>
          <h2>Symptoms of Barotrauma</h2>
          <p> The most common barotrauma symptom a diver experiences  may be mild discomfort to intense pain in the sinus or middle ear - this is  almost always the first indication of a problem in equalising. Middle ear barotrauma  may also include symptoms of ringing or hearing loss. As blood or fluid  accumulates in the middle ear a diver may experience a partial, complete or  muffled hearing loss as well as damage to the inner ear. Roaring in the ear,  nausea, vomiting, dizziness, a sensation of spinning and decreased hearing may  also indicate inner ear barotrauma. Blood from the nose or in the sputum is  also an indication of barotrauma and does not have to be associated with other  symptoms. These are symptoms that should probably end the day&rsquo;s - and possibly  the week&rsquo;s - diving. Continuing to dive with barotrauma may result in serious  injury.</p>
          <h2> Treatment and Medication</h2>
          <p> If you experience any symptoms during or after a dive,  then you should consult a doctor to determine if there has been any permanent  damage, or if there is some treatable condition causing the problem. Your  physician can determine the correct treatment and medication for sinus or  middle ear barotrauma and refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist if  necessary. Proper care and medication under a doctor&rsquo;s supervision can reduce  the time divers experience barotrauma symptoms - and the sooner they can get  back into the water to enjoy diving. </p>
