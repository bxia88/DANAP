        <h1>Recognition is Essential  </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN's Marty McCafferty, EMT-P, DMT</em></p>
        <h3>The Diver</h3>
        <p align="justify">The diver was an experienced 48-year-old female with more than 300   lifetime dives. Her medical history included hypertension that was well   controlled with a single medication. She also took a prescription drug   to manage her cholesterol. Her general health and fitness were otherwise   good.</p>
        <h3 align="justify">The Dives </h3>
        <p align="justify">The diver was on a trip at a popular Caribbean island. The first four   days of diving consisted of two morning dives each day. None of these   dives was deeper than 80 feet, and all bottom times were within her   computer's no-decompression limits. Her second dive each day was to 60   feet or shallower, and she breathed air on all the dives. On the fifth   day, her first dive was a multilevel one to a maximum depth of 85 feet   for a total time of 40 minutes. The dive was uneventful, and she exited   the water at approximately 11:30 a.m.<br />
          <br />
          Within five minutes of   surfacing, the diver began to feel slightly short of breath while she   was removing her equipment. This was followed by soreness in her middle   and upper back. As she was moving her equipment she noticed reduced   strength in her right arm. Almost simultaneously both of her feet began   to tingle, and the sensation progressed up both legs to her waist.   Fatigue accompanied all these symptoms.<br />
          <br />
          She reported the   situation to the dive boat crew. They did not act alarmed and suggested   that oxygen was not necessary because the reported weakness in her right   arm resolved on its own within 15 minutes. The diver chose not to   participate in a second dive. The other divers were in the water for an   hour. During that time her symptoms seemed to resolve, except for the   tingling in her feet.<br />
          <br />
        Back at the resort the symptoms did not   return, but the tingling in her feet remained unchanged. She did not   engage in any vigorous physical activity that afternoon and, after   dinner, retired for the evening at approximately 9:45 p.m.</p>
        <h3>The Complications </h3>
        <p align="justify">At 11:30 p.m. the diver awoke due to acute discomfort in her bladder.   She discovered that she was unable to urinate and upon reflection   realized she had not urinated since the dive that morning. She took a   warm shower, during which she became aware of unusual sensations in her   feet and patchy sensitive areas on her legs. She reported that her legs   also felt rubbery. As her concern grew she contacted DAN and spoke with   the medic on call. Based on the evolution of signs and symptoms she   reported, the medic recommended that she be evaluated at a nearby   medical facility immediately. She spoke with the resort manager, who   transported her to the local clinic.<br />
          <br />
        As the clinic staff began   their evaluation, the first priority was to empty the diver's bladder,   and they promptly did so using a urinary catheter. The staff recognized   the possibility of a decompression injury and began making arrangements   with the local hyperbaric facility. They also placed the diver on   high-flow oxygen (15 liters per minute via a nonrebreather mask). Due to   staffing issues the diver was not transferred to the hyperbaric   facility for another two hours, but she did continue breathing high-flow   oxygen during her time at the clinic and during transport, which was   uneventful.</p>
        <h3>The Evaluation </h3>
        <p align="justify">Upon arrival at the chamber facility the diver was fully alert and   oriented and able to provide the treating doctor with a detailed account   of the events and the evolution of her symptoms. The physician   conducted a neurological exam and discovered no problems with the   diver's right arm. Strength in her arms was equal, and reflexes were   normal. The soreness in her middle and upper back had not returned.<br />
	      <br />
	      Neurological   evaluation of the lower extremities revealed reduced strength in the   right hip-flexor muscles compared with the same muscles on the left   side. There was also reduced sensation in the left leg and patchy areas   of altered sensation in the right leg. Perception of hot and cold   stimuli was altered in both feet. The diver was unsteady while   attempting to walk heel to toe, she found it difficult to stand on one   leg, and she reported that her legs still felt rubbery. The treating   physician diagnosed her with decompression sickness (DCS) Type II with   spinal cord involvement.<br />
	      <br />
The   staff initiated a U.S. Navy Treatment Table 6 (TT6). About halfway   through the treatment the diver reported improvement. Following the   treatment, a repeat neurological evaluation revealed marginally improved   strength in the right leg. The diver also reported improved sensation   in her feet. She was helped back to the resort, where she slept for a   few hours before returning for an additional treatment. During a shower   she noticed improvement in her ability to distinguish hot and cold   sensations. The diver's ability to walk heel to toe was also improved,   and she had less trouble standing on one leg. The doctor decided to   administer a second TT6, after which an evaluation showed further   improvement.<br />
<br />
The next day the diver was evaluated again and   treated with a U.S. Navy TT5 (a shorter chamber treatment), again with   incremental improvement. Three additional shorter U.S. Navy TT9   treatments were provided. The diver had reached a clinical plateau,   showing no further improvement after the second and third TT9, so no   further treatments were administered. Some slight sensory decrements   were still present, but the physician's opinion was that the diver would   continue to improve. After waiting the recommended 72 hours, the diver   flew home and experienced no worsening of her symptoms during the   flights. Two weeks later she reported continued daily improvement with   only mild sensory alteration remaining in her feet.</p>
	    <h3>The Discussion </h3>
	    <p>It would be easy to criticize the boat crew for their failure to act;   they had probably seen people dive those profiles without incident many   times and were thus lulled into complacency. Further confounding this   case was the spontaneous resolution of most of the diver's symptoms.   Such resolution of symptoms is typically a response to breathing oxygen,   but in rare cases it may even occur in the absence of oxygen first aid.   Although not all of this diver's symptoms resolved, the improvement of   most of her symptoms made this situation appear much less severe than it   actually was.<br />
	      <br />
        It is important to remember that the signs and   symptoms this diver exhibited can be considered profound, but even   subtle signs or symptoms warrant at least an informal conversation to   determine the extent of problems. Any loss of muscular strength should   prompt immediate evaluation and intervention. The DAN Neurological   Assessment course provides knowledge and skills for recognizing and   assessing potentially injured divers; no matter what training you have,   don't hesitate to recommend that a diver seek professional medical   evaluation. Regardless of whether symptoms that appear after a dive are   subtle or obvious, if they resolve with oxygen first aid — or even   without it — don't discount the possibility that they will return.</p>
