        <h2>September Diving Incident Statistics</h2>
        <p align="justify">DAN Asia-Pacific is continuing to share with the recreational   diving community a sample of &ldquo;Calls for Help&rdquo; received at the DAN AP   office. We hope sharing these statistics will further encourage divers   to be aware of potential issues, be prepared and dive carefully.</p>
        <p align="justify"> During the month of September the DAN AP office received calls from a   broad range of countries, including the Philippines, Truk Lagoon, Niue,   the Solomons and Italy.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><a href="http://www.danasiapacific.org/main/diving_safety/sept12_incidents.php">CLICK HERE</a> to view a sample of non-fatal calls for help involving DAN AP Members during September 2012.</strong></p>

They exclude the calls made directly to the various DAN   Asia-Pacific 24-Hour Emergency Hotlines, or via one of the other DAN   branches: DAN America, DAN Europe, DAN Southern Africa, DAN Japan).

        <p align="justify">We will continue sharing these statistics with you on a regular basis   in the hope you and your dive buddies are aware that diving incidents   do occur and the importance of being prepared.</p>

        <h2>DAN Asia-Pacific Monthly Diving Incident Statistics - July 2012 </h2>
        <p align="justify"> DAN Asia-Pacific is continuing to share with the recreational diving community a sample of &ldquo;Calls for Help&rdquo;   received at the DAN AP office. We hope  sharing these statistics will   further encourage divers to be aware of potential  issues, be prepared   and dive carefully.</p>
        <p align="justify">During the month of July the DAN AP office received calls from a broad range of countries, including Indonesia, Fiji, Thailand, and Australia. The need for help  ranged from stroke, a motorbike accident, DCI and Ear Barotrauma. Two serious cases required an Emergency Medical Evacuation by air to another country for Treatment. One of these evacuations was at the cost of $70,000.</p>

        <p align="justify">Being prepared involves becoming a member   of an organisation  that has a sole mission of helping divers in need.   The Divers Alert Network  (DAN) has 30+ years experience of helping   divers in emergency situations.</p>
        <h2>DAN AP Launches Member-Only Portal on Website </h2>
        <p>We are delighted to annouce the launch of a Member-Only Portal on the DAN AP website. Our objective is to share with Members, a range of materials that will further develop their diving health and safety knowledge and skills. The Member-Only section will contain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Online Seminars</strong>: In a first for DAN AP, you will be able to access Online Seminars on a range of topics, such as <em>Diver Fatalities</em> and <em>Medications and Diving</em>. The first seminar ready to be viewed via the Portal is &quot;<em>Diver Accident Management</em>&quot;.</li>
          <li> <strong>Reports on DCI and Diving Fatalities</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong> Findings from recent Research Initiatives</strong>. </li>
          <li> <strong>Articles from past issues of <em>Alert Diver</em> magazine</strong>. </li>
          <li> <strong>Dowloads of Books</strong>, commencing with<em> Diving Medicine for Scuba Divers</em> and the <em>Sports Diving Medical</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>          We will continue adding to the website. New Online Seminars will be announced in <em>Alert Diver </em>magazine and <em>Deeper with DAN</em>.</p>
        <p>          As a Member-Only benefit the site can only be accessed with a current DAN Asia-Pacific Member Number.</p>
        <p><strong>Current Members can log into the website by</strong> <a href="http://www.danasiapacific.org/main/member_only/index.php">CLICKING HERE</a>. </p>
        <h2>Updated DAN Doc Website</h2>
        <p align="justify">DAN AP&rsquo;s dedicated diving medical issues website has been  given a facelift. If you have a medical condition, concern or question relating  to dive health and safety then the DAN Doc website is for you. </p>
        <p align="justify">The dedicated website addresses a broad range of medical  issues from decompression illness, the nervous system, medications to  cardiovascular fitness and much more.</p>

        <h2>Have You Ever Wondered How DAN Helps Divers? </h2>
        <p>Speaking  to divers throughout the Asia-Pacific region a recurring question concerns &ldquo;<em>How  Can DAN Help Me?&rdquo; </em></p>
        <p>Divers are often concerned that a DAN office does not  exist in each country of the Asia-Pacific. However, the reality is that a  physical office in each country does not affect the level of assistance and  care provided to the diver. Systems created to best assist a member are  activated as soon as a call for help is received via a DAN 24-hour emergency  hotline. </p>
        <p>To  assist divers, DAN AP has created a flow chart that highlights, step-by-step,  what happens from the moment a call for help is received from a Member. </p>
        <p>The  Flow Chart can be downloaded from the Dive Safety section on the DAN AP  website. We hope this will provide divers with a simple overview of DAN&rsquo;s  assistance process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With  30+ years experience helping divers in trouble, the Divers Alert Network is the  expert in diver accident management.</p>

           <h2>DAN's Jellyfish Investigation </h2>
        <p align="justify">As mentioned  in the last few issues of <em>Deeper with DAN</em> and <em>Alert Diver</em>, there  has been an increase in reported serious jellyfish stings in Thailand, and  possibly elsewhere in Asia. Since mentioning our jellyfish investigation we  have received several great photos of jellyfish, some being dangerous species  found in Thailand and the Philippines. DAN AP encourages any underwater  photographers in Asia, especially Thailand,&nbsp;to photograph any jellyfish  they see on a dive and send a copy of the photo to us. <em>Please be sure to  document as precisely as possible the locations of each photo. </em>Your  assistance will enable us to increase our understanding, to better catalogue  the potentially dangerous species present in parts of our region and help in  establishing appropriate prevention and management strategies. </p>
        <p>We have  produced a large poster with images of some potentially deadly jellyfish and  useful first aid and prevention advice. We have already begun to distribute  these in Thailand and plan to make them available elsewhere in the Region. </p>
