          <h2>Provider Level Training (Answers) </h2>
          <h3>FAQs for Trainees (Answers)</h3>
          <p><span class="faq">1. What  courses are offered by DAN Asia-Pacific Instructors?<a name="faq1" id="faq1"></a></span> </p>
          <p>DAN AP Instructors can offer a range of First Aid and Safety related courses. These courses include: Oxygen Provision for Diving Accidents as well as Oxygen for General First Aid, Advanced Oxygen Provision, First Aid Programs from Emergency Life Support (Level 1) and Apply First Aid (Level 2) through to Advanced First Aid (Level 3), CPR, Automated External Defibrillators, On-Site Neurological Examination for Divers and First Aid for Hazardous Marine Life Injuries. </p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#1faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p><span class="faq">2. Why  should I do a DAN course?<a name="faq2" id="faq2"></a></span><br />
            DAN Training programs are well-respected courses for everyone not just for divers. DAN is a world leader in the provision of accident management training for the diving community, workplace and beyond. All of the DAN Asia-Pacific Courses follow the current ILCOR guidelines for resuscitation.  In Australia, the courses conform to the guidelines of the Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) and a number of them are recognised under the national training framework in Australia. </p>

          </ul>
          <p>All DAN  Instructors have to complete annual re-certification requirements in order to  maintain the highest possible standards and are routinely subjected to quality  assurance procedures.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#2faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p><span class="faq">3. Who  can undertake a DAN AP Provider course and what are the minimum requirements?<a name="faq3" id="faq3"></a></span><br />
            To undertake a DAN Provider course you must have basic numeracy and literacy skills and be able to understand and read English (except where materials are available in other languages). You must also have the strength and agility to be able to manage CPR and other emergency situations. Some of the programs also have minimum age requirements (14 for Oxygen Provider and 16 for Advanced O2). For the Advanced Oxygen course you will need to have completed the DAN Oxygen Provider course.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#3faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">4. I  want to do a DAN course but there is not an instructor listed on your website  in my area. How can I find an Instructor who is close by?<a name="faq4" id="faq4"></a></p>
          <p>DAN AP has  hundreds of Instructors based throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The list on  the website is very small. <a href="mailto:training@danap.org">Email DAN Training</a> to find out the  contact details of Instructors in your area. Make sure you tell us where you  want to do the course.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#4faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">5. How  do I know if my Instructor is really a currently certified DAN Instructor?<a name="faq5" id="faq5"></a></p>
          <p>DAN AP Instructors  are issued with an updated certificate each year. This certificate lists all  courses they are authorized to teach. If you are not sure you can always contact  the <a href="mailto:training@danap.org">DAN AP Training Department</a> </p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#5faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">6. How  much do DAN Provider courses cost?<a name="faq6" id="faq6"></a></p>
          <p>We do not  set the prices for courses. The Instructor providing the course will advise you  of the fee. This fee includes your materials and certification. There are no  additional payments to DAN.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#6faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="b2t">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="faq">7. I  did a DAN course a while ago and have not received my certificate. What can I  do?<a name="faq8" id="faq8"></a></p>
          <p>            IN <span class="em">AUSTRALIA</span> Your first step is to contact your DAN Instructor. Once DAN receives the course paperwork from the Instructor and registers the trainee all certificates are sent to the Instructors for them to sign and forward to trainees.</p>
          <p>If your Instructor is not able to assist with your query then you should contact the <a href="mailto:training@danap.org">DAN AP Training Department</a></p>
          <p><span class="em">OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA</span> For an Oxygen Provider course you should have received your certificate directly from your Instructor when you completed the course. If this did not happen then contact the DAN AP Training department.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#8faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">8. Do  I get a &ldquo;C&rdquo; Card from DAN for my Provider course?<a name="faq9" id="faq9"></a></p>
          <p>DAN AP does  not provide &ldquo;C&rdquo; Cards for provider level courses. You will however receive a  wall certificate this will be sent out to you when your registration is  completed (except for people doing Oxygen Provider courses outside of Australia  and NZ who will receive their certificate directly from their instructor upon  completion of their course).</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#9faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">9. I  would like to let DAN know how much I enjoyed my course. How can I do this?<a name="faq10" id="faq10"></a></p>
          <p>We love to hear about DAN Instructors who have done a good job. If you would like to share your thoughts about the course you completed feel free to email the <a href="mailto:training@danap.org">DAN AP Training department</a>. Also you can email us if you had an experience that was not as good as you had hoped &ndash; these emails help us to identify Instructors who are doing the right (and wrong) things so we can praise them (or fix the problems).</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#10faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">10. What  languages are the DAN Provider course materials available in?<a name="faq11" id="faq11"></a></p>
          <p>All DAN  Course materials are available in English. We are also in the process of  getting Chinese and Korean language versions of all DAN AP course texts.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#11faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">11. Can  I do any DAN courses online?<a name="faq12" id="faq12"></a></p>
          <p>There is  provision for doing the theory component of the DAN AP Apply First Aid course  online. You should discuss this option with your Instructor, as this option is  not available in all areas.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#12faq">Back to Top</a></p>
          <p class="faq">12. I  have lost my DAN certificate, how do I get a replacement?<a name="faq13" id="faq13"></a></p>
          <p>Contact DAN  AP Training and we can issue a replacement. There is a small fee for re-issuing  the certificate.</p>
          <p class="b2t"><a href="#13faq">Back to Top </a></p>
            <p class="faq">13. I  did a course with a DAN Instructor and now I have received a Quality Assurance  Questionnaire. Why do I need to return this to DAN?<a name="faq14" id="faq14"></a></p>
            <p>These  questionnaires are an important part of our Quality Assurance procedures. We  need you to complete and return these to us so that we can ensure that all our  Instructors are maintaining the standards of these courses at the highest  levels.</p>

	        <p>For all  orders we suggest that you allow seven working days (in Australia) or longer  (overseas) to ensure you have the materials in time for your course. DAN AP is  not able to take phone orders. </p>
