        <h1>Diver Below : Be Aware : Safety Campaign</h1>
        <p align="justify">Deaths and very severe injuries still routinely  occur as a result of boats coming into contact with divers. The resulting  trauma is often horrendous and these accidents have an enormous impact on those  involved, including witnesses, first aiders and the victims&rsquo; families. </p>
        <p align="justify">Many divers and operators still do not use  a dive flag, and this is very risky. In addition, many boat operators and  casual drivers are unaware of the meaning of a dive flag, or fail to realise  the potential consequences of impact with a diver.</p>
        <p align="justify">This situation presents a real challenge to  divers and the diving industry and we should all do our part in trying to  educate divers, fishermen and other boat users about the meaning of the &ldquo;Diver  Below&rdquo; Flag and the potential consequences of not using or heeding it.</p>
        <p>As the following incidents highlight, the  risk of propeller-related injuries is very real:</p>
        <h2>Australia</h2>
        <p align="justify">This  25-year-old man went spearfishing with a friend from the shore in a marine  park. The weather was sunny, there was little wind and the sea was calm and  clear. He wore a black mask, snorkel and fins; army camouflage-coloured wetsuit  with a black hood; and black and white gloves. They did not use a float with a  dive flag.</p>
        <p align="justify">He and  his buddy snorkelled for over an hour about 30&ndash;50 metres from shore in water  about 3m deep before the buddy returned to shore and the victim continued to  spearfish. Shortly afterwards, a high-powered tourist boat driven at high speed  collided with the victim. Some of the passengers saw the victim surface briefly  just in front of the boat. However, the boat driver had not noticed the diver  as he was driving from a rear console with the passengers seated in front of  him and there was no designated lookout to warn him. </p>
        <p align="justify">Although  the investigating coroner concluded that the vessel was likely travelling  faster than what was safe in that area, there was no regulation prohibiting  this and the driver was not prosecuted.</p>
        <h2>Thailand</h2>
        <p align="justify">A tourist was snorkelling off the beach  when she was struck by a &lsquo;longtail&rsquo; boat and sustained massive head injuries  from which she died.</p>
        <h2 align="justify"><strong>New Zealand</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">          The victim was diving for scallops from  a boat. Despite him displaying large (1m tall) dive flags above his dive site,  a boat hit him after his dive. The driver of the boat claimed to have not seen  the flags and after hitting the diver he assumed people were yelling at him to  slow down because they were fishing. He claimed that he had been traveling  between 4-8 knots in a 5 knot zone but the boats speed could not be verified.  The accident was fatal.</p>
        <h2 align="justify"><strong>Malaysia</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">          The victim was participating in an Advanced Open Water course and was  on a night dive from a busy jetty where there were several boats and other  divers. Towards the end of the dive, the victim ascended for unknown reasons  and was struck on the head and arms by a boat propeller. He suffered severe  injuries to head and both arms. </p>
        <p align="justify">He was pulled from the water and first aid was applied as he was  initially conscious. However, he deteriorated and was given CPR and oxygen and  then was transported by boat to the mainland but died on the way.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">Thailand</h2>
        <p align="justify">A student on his third open water dive  had equalisation problems on descent. He ascended slightly and the current  pushed him into the turning propeller of a moving dive boat. The propeller  struck him in the head causing massive head injuries and also multiple  fractures to the body. He was pulled on to the boat and found to be in cardiac  arrest. CPR was commenced on the boat. Paramedics arrived quickly and continued  CPR for a further 30 minutes without success. There was no Surface Marker to  indicate that there was a diver below.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">Thailand</h2>
        <p align="justify">The diver was newly-certified with 4  logged dives. She went out with 3 friends as a buddy group. Her buddies  reported that during the safety stop the victim ascended to the surface  uncontrollably and was killed instantly by a speedboat that was leaving the  area. The propeller caused massive head injuries. The group was not using a  safety marker buoy.</p>
        <h2 align="justify"><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">          Education is the key to preventing these  unfortunate and unavoidable incidents, particularly in areas where there is  little understanding of what a dive flag represents. </p>
        <p align="justify">The Diver Below flyer is currently  available in English, Bahasa Indonesian and Traditional Chinese, and soon to be  Malay and Simplified Chinese. </p>
        <p align="justify">DAN Asia-Pacific would like to send the Diver  Below flyers to all operators and divers within the Asia-Pacific that can  display or distribute the flyer amongst relevant people. To obtain a quantity  of flyers, and assist DAN in getting this important message into the community,  send us an<strong> <a href="mailto:marketing@danasiapacific.org">email</a></strong>.</p>
        <p><em>Let&rsquo;s work together to prevent propeller-related  injuries and fatalities.</em></p>
