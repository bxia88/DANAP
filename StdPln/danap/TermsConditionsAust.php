  <br />

        <p align="justify">DAN AP ABN 67 066 827 129 (Corporate Authorised Representative Licence  No. 269340) is an Authorised Representative of Marsh &amp; McLennan Agency Pty Ltd ABN 33 000 668 584, AFSL 238984.   A <a href="http://www.danasiapacific.org/main/_pdf/fsgcurrent.pdf">Financial Services Guide</a> is available from DAN AP and on this website which provides important   information about DAN AP's relationship and is intended to assist you   in your decision whether to use any of our services. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>General Advice Warning</strong> &ndash; It is important that you   understand and are happy  with the policy DAN AP can arrange for you.   DAN AP can give you general  information to help you decide but cannot   advise you on whether the terms are  specifically appropriate for your   individual objectives, financial situation or  needs. DAN AP therefore   recommends that you should carefully read the relevant  Product   Disclosure Statement and other information DAN AP provides before    deciding.</p>
        <p align="justify"> <strong>DISCLOSURE</strong><br />
          Before you enter into a contract of general insurance with an insurer,   you have  a duty, under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, to disclose   to the insurer  every matter that you know, or could reasonably be   expected to know, is  relevant to the insurer's decision whether to   accept the risk of the insurance  and, if so, on what terms.<br />
          Your duty, however, does not require disclosure of matters: <br />
  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;that diminish the risk to be undertaken by the insurer,<br />
  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are of common knowledge, <br />
  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;that your insurer knows or, in the ordinary course of its  business, ought to know, or <br />
  &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to which compliance with your duty is waived by the insurer. <br />
  <br />
          If you enter into a contract of insurance on behalf of any related   subsidiary or related company of the named insured, that subsidiary or   related company has the same duty of disclosure as the named insured.   You agree to act on behalf of all insureds under this insurance.</p>
        <p align="justify">Non-Disclosure <br />
          If you fail to comply with your duty of disclosure, the insurer may be   entitled  to reduce its liability under the contract in respect of a   claim, or may cancel  the contract. If your non-disclosure is   fraudulent, the insurer may also have  the option of avoiding the   contract from its beginning.&nbsp;PLEASE NOTE THAT  YOUR DUTY APPLIES ALSO   WHEN YOU RENEW, AMEND, ALTER, VARY OR ENDORSE A POLICY.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>UTMOST GOOD FAITH</strong><br />
          Every insurance contract is subject  to the doctrine of utmost good   faith, which requires that parties to the  contract should act toward   each other honestly and fairly, avoiding any attempt  to deceive in   assuming and performing contractual obligations. Failure to do so  on   the part of the insured may permit the insurer to refuse to pay a claim   or  to cancel the policy.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Product Disclosure Statement</strong><br />
          A Product Disclosure Statement is available for this  product.&nbsp;You   should obtain a copy of the PDS and consider the statement  before   making any&nbsp;decision about whether to acquire the product.&nbsp; To  obtain a   copy of the PDS contact DAN AP or <a href="http://www.danasiapacific.org/main/_pdf/pdscurrent.pdf">click here</a> to download a copy&nbsp;.&nbsp;  This product is underwritten and issued by Certain Underwriters at  Lloyds.&nbsp;</p>
