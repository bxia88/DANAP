<h2> Marsh Insurance:</h2>
<p>These are all the pages that have been changed to reflect removal of Standard Plan <br>
The only change made on all the pages, except the ausrescheck page, is the removal of all references to the Standard Plan<br> 
For the Austrescheck2 page the change is in the addition of the important information regarding Standard Plan section. <br><br>
<strong>Note 1</strong>: links within the pages will not work (unless the pages linked also had references to Std Plan) <br>
<strong>Note 2</strong>: see the attachments to the email sent to Eman 16/09/14 for the wording of the renewal reminder emails and letters. The email itself also contains details as to the current timing of the reminders.</p>
