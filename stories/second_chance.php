        <h1>This is my story &ndash; Let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;A Second Chance&rdquo;</h1>
        <p><em>By DAN Member Rolf Rasig</em></p>
        <p align="justify">Recently my DAN Membership came up for  renewal &ndash; no problem I thought, hop on the internet, type the requested information  &ndash; done! But it was not as straight forward as I thought it would be.</p>
        <p align="justify">          There it was, an email from DAN requesting a  Dive Medical because of my age! At first I was a bit annoyed at the  inconvenience but then I thought, it actually makes sense, because I am pushing  75 years of age. I am still working full time as a Toolmaker so I thought I was  fit and healthy. Any staircase I would take two steps at once and my lungs  still allowed me to snorkel dive for a full minute in our pool or skin dive  down 8-10m outside of Pope&rsquo;s Eye  Rock.</p>
		<p align="center"><img src="_images/rolf_diving.jpg" width="250" height="180" /> </p>
        <p align="justify">          So  after a lifetime of snorkelling, spearfishing, and then taking up underwater  photography, I couldn&rsquo;t see any problems with my mental or physical condition.  As far as I was concerned, all I needed was a Sports Doctor who would give me a  check up, tick all the boxes and sign the form. </p>
        <p align="justify">By making a couple of phone calls, I  established that my former GP (also a Sports Doctor) was still practicing. Due  to the fact that I had not been for any checkups for such a long time, the GP  wanted to run all the tests modern medicine can throw at us. That meant Blood  Samples had to be taken, a Glucose Tolerance Test for Diabetes, Urine samples  and Lung capacity, Body weight, Chest X-ray, you name it, we did it. And then  he also ordered a Cardiac Stress Test. So off I went to be tested on a  treadmill, fully wired up so they could see my heart performance under load by  means of an ECG. They make you walk faster and faster and also uphill for a  specified time, so needless to say, I was rather puffed at the end of the  exercise.</p>
        <p align="justify">          The result of this test was reported back to  my doctor and to my shock showed some abnormalities with my heart. I was  referred to a cardiologist for an angiogram, which involves a day procedure in  hospital where they inject a contrast dye into your veins (in my case through  the arm) and with the help of an X-ray machine, they can see any possible  obstruction or narrowing in the arteries in your heart or lungs.<br />
          <br />
          After the angiogram I could see the concern  in the cardiologist&rsquo;s face and I realised, things did not look as good as I had  expected. But still hopeful, I thought they would just need to insert stents  (small mesh tubes) in the arteries, which I understood to be a pretty simple  day procedure.</p>
        <p align="justify"> But the cardiologist quickly dashed my hopes.  Inserting stents was not possible in my case due to several obstructions in  awkward places. The only option was open heart multiple bypass surgery.</p>
        <p align="justify"> I decided to wait to have the surgery, even  though the doctors wanted to perform the surgery straight away. But as I felt  fine I decided to wait, so I was sent home with all these pills and sprays in  case of an emergency.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">          All of a sudden a thousand things go through  your mind, especially &ldquo;Why Me&rdquo;? These things only happen to other people! Then  everyone tries to convince you that open heart surgery these days is fairly  routine. You worry how your employer will react when you tell them you need  weeks to recuperate; how long it will really take to be fit again to skin/scuba  dive, go skiing, boating and water-skiing with the family, if at all; and what  if things go wrong? There are lots of questions but there can be no definite  answers.<br />
	    <p align="center"><img src="_images/rolf_cabrini.jpg" width="240" height="195" /> </p> 
          <p align="justify">Now, four weeks after the operation, I must  say that the whole traumatic experience of having open heart surgery can be, to  a very large extent, reduced by all the people around you. It starts with the  support and decision making of your G.P., the capable cardiologist who monitors  your heart condition, the experience of your surgeon and the trust you put into  him and not to forget the fantastic round the clock care given by the nurses in  cardiac recovery (in my case the Cabrini Hospital in Melbourne). And, of  course, one&rsquo;s partner, who probably shared the biggest part of the experience  and shock, the loving support of the whole family, all the many friends and  workmates including the understanding and support of your work management.
        </p>
          </p>
          <p align="justify"><strong>So in hindsight, I am a very, very lucky man  to have followed up on the request by DAN to have a medical.</strong> The surgeon and  cardiologist assure me, that after my full recovery in another few months, I  will feel as good as gold and nothing should stop me going diving and pursuing  all my other activities and live to tell the tale of my &ldquo;Second Chance&rdquo;*.</p>
