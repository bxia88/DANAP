        <h1>DAN Helped Me </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN Asia-Pacific Member, Zarine </em></p>
        <h3><em>          Continued from Deeper with DAN Issue 19 </em></h3>
        <h2>I Started Feeling Very Tired </h2>
        <p align="justify">The next day, the weather wasn&rsquo;t any better, and I was quite tired after a restless night.  We did three dives that day, which seemed quite unremarkable to me. We started with a dive to 22.4m. After a four-hour surface interval we went to 22.9m and then finished with a dive to 23.1m.  After this last dive I felt very tired and a bit dizzy, feeling like I needed to catch my breath. I went to lie down, and was put on oxygen for 30 minutes, just in case. Afterwards I felt fine, so I assumed I was just tired.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next day I was feeling ok, but still tired with the lack of sleep. I completed one dive to 23.4m that morning. As with all the other dives, the ascent was normal, there were no violations according to my computer, and no deco stops were needed. The dive itself wasn&rsquo;t that memorable &ndash; it was very murky (a submerged reef), with a bit of current, and I was feeling weary and happy to ascend after 48 minutes.</p>
        <p align="justify">Upon surfacing I felt extremely tired, and decided that I needed to stop diving. I slept until the next day, and then realised that I was still unusually tired. I found it hard to think clearly and had some tingling in my little fingers. I went on oxygen for 4-5 hours until the boat returned to Singapore.</p>
        <h2>We Called DAN </h2>
        <p align="justify">Once we docked that evening, my husband called the DAN/DES hotline. We were quickly connected with a dive doctor (Dr David Wilkinson) who listened to my husband&rsquo;s description of my symptoms. The doctor spoke to me as well &ndash; even though I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was making much sense.  At this point I felt exhausted, my fingers were tingling intermittently and it was like I was seeing everything through a fog. </p>
        <p align="justify">We were soon called by John Lippmann and he directed us to either the Singapore General or Tan Tock Seng Hospital to see a diving medical specialist. He gave us the contact details and advised that he had already spoken to one of the doctors there.  We called Singapore General Hospital, and they organised for us to come in first thing in the morning rather than opening the hyperbaric unit at 10pm, given my symptoms were not life-threatening. This was fine with me, as all I wanted to do was sleep.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next day, at the hospital, the hyperbaric doctor conducted comprehensive tests, and found that in addition to tiredness, and tingling, I was very off-balance, and had paraesthesia &ndash; a difference in sensation on either side of my body.  He recommended that I have two sessions in the hyperbaric chamber to clear up the symptoms.</p>
        <p align="justify">After the two sessions, I felt much better, and the tingling and paraesthesia had resolved. It took a few more weeks before the tiredness and mental fogginess were completely gone, and I had to rest and do minimal work until I had completely recovered.</p>
        <p align="justify">DAN was invaluable throughout this whole process. John Lippmann followed every stage of my treatment, speaking with my doctors himself, and calling us regularly to check how I was doing. The medical staff at the hospital were also excellent, and very reassuring.</p>
        <h2>What I Did Wrong (Lesson's Learnt!) </h2>
        <p align="justify">I saw the hyperbaric doctor once more, several months later. My symptoms were all gone by then, and he did a number of tests to make sure everything was ok. We talked about the whole experience, and much to my surprise, he said that I had what they called a &ldquo;deserved hit&rdquo;, meaning I had been at fault. I had thought that because all my ascents were safe, and the dives were no-deco, it must have been a one-off, unfortunate experience. He explained that I had done several things that put me at risk:</p>
        <p>1) I had continued diving even though I was tired and not sleeping well;<br />
          2) I had been getting cold during the dives;<br />
          3) On the second day, my last dive was deeper than my first dive; and<br />
          4) I continued to dive on the third day, despite not feeling well on the second day.</p>
        <p align="justify">In his opinion, even though my computer had said all my profiles were safe, if I had calculated the same dives using a table, I shouldn&rsquo;t have been diving that frequently or that deeply.  He recommended setting my computer to a more conservative setting and checking my proposed dives against a dive table, just to be safe.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">A Changed Attitude </h2>
        <p align="justify">The whole experience has definitely changed my attitude to diving.  I still love it, but I am much more cautious now &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve learned to pay more attention to how I&rsquo;m feeling, and not continue diving just because everybody else is, or because I&rsquo;ve paid for the dive. In the future, I will be much more conservative with my profiles, and although I will keep using my computer, I won&rsquo;t forget that these are just guidelines, and I should keep well away from the limits. Even though my symptoms were not life threatening, it was a frightening experience, particularly as I felt so confused about what was going on. <strong>The symptoms seemed so minor at the beginning, and tiredness is common for divers anyway, so I didn&rsquo;t want to make a fuss and disrupt the trip.  But it is important to realise that minor symptoms could mean something more serious.</strong></p>
        <h2 align="left">Thank You DAN </h2>
        <p align="justify"><em>I just wanted to say thank you once again for your help. Your assistance when I was unwell was really appreciated.  Both my husband and I were very reassured by your involvement and follow-up as I was being treated and recovering.</em></p>
        <h1>Comment by DAN AP Executive Director, John Lippmann </h1>
	    <p align="justify">Zarine had some symptoms of DCI on the second day of diving and was put on oxygen for 30 minutes. Had the DAN/DES Hotline been called at this time we would likely have recommended a far longer period of oxygen breathing as 30 minutes is usually far too short to reduce or eliminate the problem. It is likely that we would have then monitored the situation and only acted further if it seemed necessary. It is quite possible that had this been done and Zarine refrained from the last dive, she might not have deteriorated and required recompression treatment.</p>
        <p align="justify">In both cases reported in this newsletter, divers failed to call the DAN/DES hotline and dived again. At least in this case the dive operator provided oxygen early on, although for far too short a time!</p>
        <p align="justify">It was very nice to meet Zarine and her husband at the recent ADEX dive show. It&rsquo;s always nice for me to put faces to the phone calls and to meet the people involved.<br />
