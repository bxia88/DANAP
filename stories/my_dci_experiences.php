         <h1>My DCI Experiences </h1>
		 
		 <h2> 2009: Bundaberg, QLD </h2>
		 
          <p align="justify"> In November 2009 we booked a trip on a liveaboard out of Bundaberg to dive Lady Musgrave Island. We motored out overnight. We arrived early morning and were in the water by 8.30am. We dived four dives the first day, three the second and one on the last day. Great diving, only one dive had a bit of current. On the last dive we saw a 3-metre tiger shark. I felt good after each dive and did all the right deco stops and slow ascents. Then we headed back to Bundaberg.</p>
          <h2><strong>Dives at Lady Musgrave Island </strong></h2>
          <p><em>Day 1 - Dive 1 was to 8.2m for 52minutes. Surface interval of 1hr 45mins. Dive 2 was to 15m for 39mins with 3mins at 5m deco. Surface interval of 1hr 30mins. Dive 3 was to 13m for 45minutes with 3mins at 5m deco. Surface interval of 1hr 45mins. Dive 4 was to 13m for 45mins with 3mins at 5m.</em></p>
          <p align="left"><em>Day 2 - Dive 1 was to 18.3m for 43 minutes with 3mins at 5m deco. Surface Interval of 1hr 15mins. Dive 2 was to 17m for 40 minutes with 3mins at 5m deco. Surface interval of 2hrs 45 mins. Dive 3 was to 18.5m for 45 minutes with 3mins at 5m deco. </em></p>
          <p><em>Day 3 - One dive to 17.6m for 42mins with 5mins at 5m.</em></p>
          <p align="justify">That night I had tingling in both hands and couldn&rsquo;t sleep. There was pain in my finger joints and the pain in my wrists and hands was intense. My head wasn&rsquo;t fuzzy like the last time though. We got up the next morning and I told my husband how I was feeling. Our first thought was, not again! We made the decision to assume the worst and act quickly. We went into Bundaberg that morning and phoned DAN. I spoke to the doctor on the DES Line and his advice was to get to the chamber at the Wesley Hospital in Brisbane. We were in walking distance of the Bundaberg Hospital so went there first. I was put on oxygen immediately upon arrival and the doctor at the hospital phoned the DAN Hotline as he hadn&rsquo;t come into contact with anyone with DCI before. The Royal Flying Doctor Service evacuated me to Brisbane hospital that afternoon. The next day I was transferred to Wesley Hospital where the hyperbaric chamber was. I spent six hours in the chamber on day one, followed by two-hour sessions on day two and day three. Due to my previous DCI they extended the time on the first session. </p>
          <p align="justify">I learnt a lot in those three days speaking to the chamber staff. The technicians couldn&rsquo;t identify why I had developed the bends, but said that doing so many dives in a short period of time would have contributed. They suggested that I shouldn&rsquo;t have followed the dive masters program, which was based on the minimal surface intervals given by a dive computer, but rather I should have been a lot more conservative. The staff at The Wesley chamber also recommended that I have a test to see if I had a PFO (patent foramen ovale) or hole in the heart, as this can make you more susceptible to DCI.          </p>
          <h2><strong>Going Through a DCI Experience </strong></h2>
		  <p align="justify">Through all the upheaval there are some positive outcomes. It is nice to know you have the backup of DAN when diving. When you are in an emotional state, the doctors and John Lippmann calm you down and talk your situation through rationally. It is a fantastic service and all the DAN Team put in 110%.</p>
		  <p align="justify">You feel such despair when you know that you have DCI. I had been through it before and knew how everything was turned upside down. I knew when I had the tingling sensation during the night and it was more severe and in both hands that I was going to make a complete mess of our holiday. I probably should have acted then and woke my husband. I think I still had a bit of denial even then.		  </p>
		  </p>
		  <h2><strong>Testing for a PFO </strong></h2>
		  <p align="justify">When I returned home my doctor gave me a CT-scan and noticed abnormal activity. She then referred me to a cardiologist. He organised a TOE (Trans Oesophageal Echocardiogram), which showed that I had a PFO. </p>
		  <p align="justify">I spoke several times with John Lippmann regarding the incident. He was very understanding and took time to make sure that everything was OK. The service from DAN was over and above my expectations. They treat you like a good friend with humility and respect. </p>
		  <h2>The Next Step</h2>
		  <p align="justify">I spoke to John again in February 2010 at the DAN Diver&rsquo;s Day about seeing someone about my TOE results and discussing my options. I made an appointment to see Dr. Andrew Fock at The Alfred, who was excellent (Ed: coincidentally, Dr Fock is also on the Board of Directors of DAN AP). Taking me through the echocardiogram results and explaining what was happening, he suggested I consider having an operation to close the hole. Until that time I could still dive but with restrictions:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Single Dives only every second day; </li>
	        <li>Max depth 20m;</li>
		    <li>Stay well within no-deco limits;</li>
		    <li>Slow ascents; </li>
		    <li>Safety stops of at least 3mins @ 5 metres on all dives;</li>
		    <li>Stay well hydrated; </li>
		    <li>Only dive when well;</li>
		    <li>Avoid strenuous diving; and </li>
		    <li>Don&rsquo;t dive cold or dive in warmer climates.</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p>I have dived Lord Howe Island the last two years, doing only two dives in 2010 and three this year.</p>
		  <p align="justify">Even though I am diving conservatively and taking precautions, I am anxious every time I dive. I am not enjoying my diving like I should because in the back of my mind I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;will I come up with the bends again&rdquo;? </p>
		  <p align="justify">I spoke to John Lippmann before we went to Lord Howe in 2011 and he mentioned that as you get older PFO's can sometimes grow larger. This may explain why some divers get decompression illness later in their diving careers. I suffer from migraines and these can also be linked to a PFO. John also explained that PFO&rsquo;s have been linked with certain strokes. He explained that, for all of these reasons, it could be worthwhile to consider whether or not an operation would be beneficial and suggested that I speak to my doctor about this. My passion is to dive and continue to enjoy it for as long as I can, so I have decided to follow up on having the operation to rectify the PFO, for my own peace of mind and a better diving experience. Even though surgery has a risk involved, I think that it is probably a good option. Although I am anxious, and hope to have the surgery this year, I look forward to enjoying my diving again without constantly worrying about whether I will have another DCI episode.</p>
		  <p>We will continue to follow Janice&rsquo;s journey over the coming months.</p>
		  <p align="justify"><em>NOTE: The latest issue of Alert Diver (January - April 2011) features another Member&rsquo;s experience with a PFO as a Diving Instructor and the process she went through to have it closed.</em></p>
		  <h2><strong>Comment from John Lippmann, DAN AP Executive Director</strong></h2>
		  <p align="justify"><em>Poor Janice had a bad run! Approximately 25-30% of the general population have a PFO and this can predispose a diver to decompression illness. Repairing a PFO will reduce this risk (and may even relieve her migraines) but will not eliminate it completely. There is always a small risk of DCI so divers should dive defensively to minimise this. Staying well short of dive computer no-stop limits, ascending slowly, doing safety stops and extending surface intervals all help to reduce the risk. I personally discourage divers from doing reverse profiles and encourage surface intervals of at least two hours.</em></p>
