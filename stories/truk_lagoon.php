         <h1>My DCI Experience: Truk Lagoon, May 2011 </h1>
		 
		 <h2> This is when the Trouble Started </h2>
		 
          <p>I was feeling lethargic and had a  bit of a headache so I told the guys I was going to have a sleep before dinner.  I asked them to wake me when they were going to dinner. From this point on I  have no recollection of the next 4 hours. Apparently I went down for dinner. I  have been told that I was talking in riddles and was disoriented.&nbsp; </p>
          <p>At dinner I was sitting next to  my doctor, who was also a diver on this trip, and it was clear to him that  something was wrong. He went to get Paul, our tour leader, who called the DAN  DES hotline. I was put on oxygen (O2) while DAN endeavoured to get  the chamber organised to receive me for treatment. At around 9.30pm &ndash;10.00pm,  and what I consider to be a short period of time, I woke up with a lot of  people in my room and a regulator in my mouth breathing O2.&nbsp; I had no idea what was going on but I was  told I needed to go into the chamber as I had DCI. </p>
          <p>Neurological tests were  conducted, which I failed miserably. At this point it is determined that  treatment cannot commence that evening, so I was required to breathe O2 all  night. The guys from our group took it in turns to keep an eye on me during the  night and change over the bottles as I emptied them.</p>
          <h2><strong>Day 5 </strong></h2>
          <p>At 10.00am we drive to the  chamber where I undergo a Table 6 recompression. Larry Bruton, Henister and the  others at the chamber were fantastic. I cannot show my appreciation enough to  the hyperbaric team at Truk, especially Henister (insert photo) who for the  first two hours of the treatment did not stop waving a fan over me. I got out  of the chamber around 5.30pm and was feeling great. </p>
          <p>John Lippmann called to see how I  was and recommended that I return to the chamber for another treatment the  following day. I had dinner as usual and a really good sleep.</p>
          <h2><strong>Day 6  </strong></h2>
		  <p>I returned to the chamber for a  Table 5 recompression. I got out of the chamber mid-afternoon and I was told  not to dive for the rest of my time in Truk. Naturally, I was very disappointed  but I completely understood. I still have no recollection of those few hours  from Day 4 but I feel fine.</p>
		  <p>I was able to fly back to Australia  with the rest of the group. The flight was 50-hours after my last treatment.  Since arriving back in Australia I have had had all sorts of tests: MRI,  Echocardiograph, stress test and a bubble Echo. As suspected, they did  determine that I have a PFO. Since then I have been cleared to dive on  restricted profiles by Dr Ken Thistlewaite at Wesley Hyperbaric Unit. He  believes that as I have been diving without incident for 23-years I should be  fine to continue my diving as long as I now dive conservatively. At this time I  have also decided not to move forward with having the PFOe closed.
	      </p>
		  </p>
		  <h2><strong>Thank you </strong></h2>
		  <p>I would like to thank the  following people who have just been fantastic with their expertise, knowledge  and the follow up to make sure I was able to recover and dive again: DAN, John  Lippmann, Dr Glen Hawkins (treating doctor), Larry Bruton (hyperbaric  technician in Truk), Paul White (Sunreef Dive Centre), and Dr Robert Bierman  (Personal GP)</p>
		  <h2>Returning to the Water </h2>
		  <p align="justify">After my experience in May, my  first time back in the water was July 23rd. I am pleased to say it  was without incident. I am feeling really good. I&rsquo;ve undergone all the tests to  make sure that my body is healthy and I am now looking forward to a week in  Fiji this August where I will celebrate my 50th birthday with a few  close friends.</p>
		  <p align="justify">Again I cannot thank DAN enough  for everything that was done for me during my time of need. The  professionalism, follow up and the way the staff care about you is fantastic.</p>
		  <h2 align="justify"><strong><em>Following is a recount of Gavin&rsquo;s  DCI experience as told by Paul White, owner of Sunreef Dive Centre in QLD,  Supporter of DAN, and Tour Leader of the Truk Lagoon Trip.</em></strong></h2>
		  <p>As the group leader on this trip  to Truk I was involved from the outset in Gavin&rsquo;s experience with DCI. </p>
		  <p align="justify">As a dive shop owner we always  recommend and promote DAN to all our divers that travel with us on our overseas  trips. Gavin&rsquo;s experience reinforced DAN&rsquo;s expertise and what an exceptional  service the organisation provides to ill divers.</p>
		  <p align="justify">All dives undertaken had been  completed without incident. Following Gavin&rsquo;s last dive he said he felt a  little tired but exhibited no DCI symptoms. When he came down for dinner after  having a rest it was like he had received a knock to the head: He kept  repeating himself and was in a confused state. As it happened one of the other  divers in our group was Gavin&rsquo;s personal GP, so when he witnessed Gavin&rsquo;s state  he immediately informed me. As soon as I saw the state he was in I immediately  contacted the DAN DES Hotline.</p>
		  <p align="justify">For those that have not been to Chuuk,  things like getting a phone to work or even a reliable power supply can be a  challenge! The time was around 7.30pm (local time) when I got through to the  DAN Hotline.&nbsp; I explained Gavin&rsquo;s  condition and provided Gavin&rsquo;s dive profiles so the doctor could get a better  understanding of the situation.</p>
		  <p>He advised us to get Gavin onto O2  immediately and monitor his condition. Based on the information we provided,  the doctor advised that it appeared to be a neurological bend. I was advised  that DAN AP Executive Director, John Lippmann, would give me a call back within  20 minutes to discuss the plan for treatment.</p>
		  <p align="justify">After about 15 minutes I received  a three way call back from John Lippmann and Dr Hawkins. After a short  consultation it was decided that Gavin should receive treatment in the local  chamber.<br />
		    . <br />
		    No one was contactable by phone  at the chamber so the guys from the resort sent out a search party around the  island and found the chamber operator who immediately started to arrange his  staff for the treatment. </p>
		  <p align="justify">Treatment could not commence  until the next morning&nbsp; so John and Dr  Hawkins advised us to keep Gavin on O2all night and have someone  watch over him the entire time. If there was any deterioration in Gavin&rsquo;s  condition we were to contact them immediately. Fortunately Gavin&rsquo;s condition  improved dramatically after about 1.5 hours on O2. It was just me  that had issues staying awake!</p>
		  <p align="justify">The next morning we updated John  and Dr Hawkins about Gavin&rsquo;s condition and we took Gavin to the chamber for  treatment. The chamber operator was aware of all the details and had been  contacted by both John and Dr Hawkins about the required treatment and that DAN  had agreed to cover the costs.</p>
		  <p align="justify">The chamber staff were  exceptional and made the chamber (and experience) as comfortable as possible  for Gavin.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
		    After the treatment, Gavin was  feeling better. The Staff spoke with John and Dr Hawkins re the treatment and  Gavin&rsquo;s condition. I was then called by John to discuss Gavin&rsquo;s treatment and  the recommendation that he undergo a further chamber treatment the following  day.</p>
		  <p align="justify">That evening John checked in with  me to see how Gavin was. The next day the final treatment was completed. Gavin  was given the all clear by Dr Hawkins to fly back to Australia with the rest of  the group.</p>
		  <h2 align="justify">Dealing with DAN </h2>
		  <p align="justify">		    I cannot fault DAN&rsquo;s involvement.  From the very first phone call to follow-up phone calls all the way through the  treatment, and then to Gavin on his arrival back in Australia, DAN, were  constantly in touch.</p>
		  <p align="justify">I would personally like to thank  John Lippmann, Dr Hawkins and Larry and all the chamber staff in Chuuk, along  with the Crew from Blue Lagoon Dive Centre for the personal and very  professional service provided to Gavin.</p>
		  For me it was my first dealings with DAN in an  emergency situation. And based on this experience I will not only continue to  recommend DAN coverage for my groups, I will make it compulsory!
		  <h2 align="justify"><br />
	      COMMENT BY JOHN LIPPMANN </h2>
		  <p align="justify">I must admit we were quite  concerned about Gavin<strong> </strong>given his  level of confusion and loss of memory. As is often the case, it was sometimes  very difficult to get through on the Truk telephone system but we managed to do  so repeatedly but only after much perseverance. </p>
		  <p align="justify">Unfortunately the chamber wasn&rsquo;t  available for treatment that night as routine maintenance was still being  finalised on the chamber. It was a great relief that there was a very good  supply of oxygen and some suitable delivery equipment so that Gavin was able to  breathe high concentration oxygen throughout the night in his hotel room with  friends watching over him. Paul was a real asset. As a result, he was very much  better in the morning. If oxygen wasn&rsquo;t available he could have been  substantially worse. Happily he responded well to recompression and has  recovered well. </p>
		  <p align="justify">As indicated, he was later found  to have a small PFO which might, or might not have, contributed to his DCI. He  was advised that if he continued to dive, he should do so very conservatively  to minimise bubble formation after diving and the likelihood of DCI. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		  <p>On a final note, the cost of the  two-recompression sessions that Gavin underwent in Chuuk cost a total of  $6,000.</p>
		  <h2>So What Is Neurological DCI? </h2>
		  <p align="justify">Divers  with decompression illness (DCI) quite often have some damage to their nervous  system. The signs of this are often vague and may go unrecognised, causing  delays in treatment.</p>
		  <p align="justify">Information regarding the injured  diver's neurological status will be useful to medical personnel in not only  deciding the initial course of treatment but also in the effectiveness of  treatment. Examination of an injured diver's central nervous system soon after  an accident may provide valuable information to the physician responsible for  treatment. </p>
		  <p align="justify">To  determine neurological DCI, tests are conducted on  the divers. These include: orientation, eyes, face, hearing, swallowing  reflex, tongue, muscle strength, sensory perception, as well as their balance  and co-ordination. </p>
		  <p align="justify">Tests  to the divers orientation, muscle strength and balance &amp; co-ordination are  most important and should be given priority if not all tests can be performed.</p>
		  <p align="justify">The specific tests involved in conducting  a Neurological Assessment on an injured diver are shown in the appendices of the <strong><em>DAN Emergency Handbook</em></strong>, which many  of you have received with their DAN Renewal. </p>
		  <h2 align="justify">DAN Asia-Pacific On-Site Neurological Assessment Course </h2>
		  <p align="justify">	      The On-Site Neurological  Assessment Course can be undertaken by individuals with no medical experience.  The course is designed to teach recreational divers how to undertake a  neurological exam in order to assist a fellow diver in an emergency situation.  Participants also learn how to obtain essential information about a diver who  has a possible diving injury and what information should be relayed to  emergency services.</p>
		  <p align="justify">The course includes both theory  and practical sessions. At the end of this program, DAN On-Site Neurological  Assessment for Divers, participants will be able to: </p>
		  <ul type="square">
            <li>Understand and identify common warning signs of       decompression illness. </li>
		    <li>Take a dive history to determine when it is       appropriate to conduct a complete On-Site Neurological Assessment. </li>
		    <li>Use an On-Site Neurological Assessment Slate to       conduct a complete On-Site Neurological Assessment. </li>
	      </ul>

		  <h2>AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN </h2>
		  <p align="justify">As mentioned earlier, Gavin was  extremely fortunate that the local dive centre had oxygen available, and in  sufficient quantities, to get him through the extended period of time before he  was able to get into the chamber.</p>
		  <p align="justify">Realistically, if suitable oxygen  equipment was (including a demand valve and mask as well as a non-rebreather  mask) not available, or the supply was not sufficient for the extended period,  the outcome of Gavin&rsquo;s DCI would have been very different.</p>
		  <p align="justify">Truk is a remote location, and so  too are many of the &ldquo;must-dive&rdquo; destinations throughout the Asia-Pacific and  the world.</p>
		  <p>This case highlights that getting  into a chamber quickly for treatment is not always possible and the reasons for  this are varied:</p>
		  <ol>
		    <li><em>Distance:</em> Often a Chamber is not in the  immediate vicinity. As such the diver will need to travel to the facility.  Whether this is by road or boat or via an emergency evacuation, it can take  time.<br />
            </li>
		    <li><em>Staff:</em> As was seen  in this instance, at the on-set of Gavin&rsquo;s illness, the chamber was not ready  to accept him immediately for treatment. A chamber might be undergoing routine  maintenance or necessary staff might sometimes be uncontactable or unavailable.  This is far more likely in a small remote operation. Again, all these factors  result in time delays in getting the diver into the chamber.</li>
	      </ol>
		  <p>These are the realities of diving  emergencies and it is why we continue to stress to you the importance of being  prepared so you can assist your divers in the event of a diving emergency.</p>
