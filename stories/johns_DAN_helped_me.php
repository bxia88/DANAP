        <h1>DAN Helped Me </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN Asia-Pacific Member, John Silberberg (visit John's website: <a href="http://www.shotsbyjohn.com.au">www.shotsbyjohn.com.au</a>)</em></p>
        <h3><em>          Continued from Deeper with DAN Issue 21</em></h3>
        <h2>Off to the Chamber ...</h2>
        <p align="justify">So  instead of catching that plane, I caught a taxi to the Alfred Hospital and  presented myself to the duty hyperbaric doctor. He completed a set of tests and  decided I needed recompression therapy. It was evening, so it took a short  while to call in the team required to run the chamber, but I was soon  recompressed.</p>
        <p align="justify">That  first session was a five-hour treatment. The pain disappeared under pressure,  which pretty much confirms I had a bubble causing my pain. I finished the first  session with no pain but some slight alteration of sensation in my ring and  little fingers.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  next morning I did another two-hour session and by the end of it, everything  felt more or less normal. I was instructed to stay out of the water for one  month.</p>
        <h2>The Recovery</h2>
        <p align="justify">My arm was  stiff and sore for a couple of weeks after the treatment, the result of soft  tissue damage. </p>
        <p align="justify">A month  later I had 100% function and strength, and 99.9% normal sensation. I still had  a slight altered sensation in my ring and little fingers. </p>
        <p align="justify">In January,  I had an appointment with Dr David Smart at the Royal Hobart Hospital, who  cleared me to dive. He highlighted that because I&rsquo;ve been bent my chances of it  happening again are statistically increased and we discussed my return to  diving.</p>
        <p align="justify">I&rsquo;m now  symptom-free and diving again.&nbsp; My first  couple of dives were shallow and very conservative, I even used a  high-concentration nitrox mix during my safety stops, just to make sure I had  no problems.</p>
        <p align="justify">Having had  an issue with travelling to altitude, I&rsquo;m cautious about driving home after a  big dive.&nbsp; Guidelines on driving to  altitude are hard to find, but I plan my route to avoid big hills, and will  stay overnight rather than drive straight home.</p>
        <h2>Lesson's Learnt</h2>
        <p align="justify">As  a diver, decompression illness, or &lsquo;the bends&rsquo;, is something that happens to  someone else and if you do everything right you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. <em>Right?</em> Wrong! My experience highlights  that if you do all the right things, follow all the guidelines and even add  extra conservancy, it is still possible to get bent.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">Fortunately,  I knew all this, so when it happened to me, I accepted what it was and sought  treatment.&nbsp;Acknowledging I had a problem was the best thing I did. Once I  did that, the rest was (relatively) easy. I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones. There  should be no permanent problem, but my DCI experience is something I am happy  not to repeat.</p>
        <p><em>So why did it happen?&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>There are  two factors, which I think contributed:</p>
        <p align="justify">1) <strong>The  obvious one is that I flew</strong>. A change of altitude is a known decompression  illness hazard.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
        2) <strong>I was probably dehydrated.</strong> I       was aware of the importance of hydration and remember drinking 2-3 litres       of fluids during the day, however, a combination of tropical heat and the       dry air inside aircraft conspired against me.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  nature of decompression illness is such that <strong><em>there doesn&rsquo;t need to be a  reason</em></strong>. It&rsquo;s a numbers game. Doing the right thing can improve the odds  in the diver&rsquo;s favour, but statistically, there&rsquo;s still a chance of getting  bent.</p>
        <p align="justify">Next  time I fly after diving, I&rsquo;ll wait another day, and drink a whole lot more.  Would it have made a difference this time? I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
        <p align="justify">Ultimately  though, I did nothing &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;. My dive profiles were conservative and I  followed DAN&rsquo;s guidelines for &lsquo;Flying After Diving&rsquo;. Everyone I spoke to about  the incident was positive. I was concerned I might encounter some finger  pointing or blame, but that hasn&rsquo;t happened.</p>
        <p>I  owe thanks to the DAN Divers Emergency Service (DES) Hotline, the Divers Alert  Network and the staff of the Hyperbaric Unit at the Alfred Hospital.<br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h1 align="justify">DAN's 'Flying After Diving' Guidelines </h1>
        <p>The DAN guidelines for flying after diving are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a single no-decompression dive, a minimum  pre-flight surface interval of 12-hours is suggested.</li>
          <li>For multiple dives per day or multiple days of  diving, a minimum pre-flight surface interval of 18-hours is suggested.</li>
          <li>For dives requiring decompression stops, there is  little evidence on which to base a recommendation. A pre-flight surface  interval substantially longer than 18 hours appears prudent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">There is no magic and safe interval for flying  after diving. The risk of DCS precipitated by flying reduces with time, and the  longer the surface interval, the lower the risk. We generally encourage divers  to wait 24 hours before flying after a dive. </p>
        <p align="justify">If you have symptoms after diving and you are  planning to fly (or drive to altitude), we suggest that you call a  DAN-supported diving hotline and seek advice prior to doing so. Sometimes  symptoms can worsen significantly during or after being at altitude. </p>
        <h1>Comment by DAN AP Executive Director, John Lippmann </h1>
	    <p align="justify">John S has covered most of the important points in a clear and  intelligent manner. However, the reality is that he did up to 4 dives a day for  6 days straight and that means he would have taken on a lot of inert gas. This  gas needs time to be eliminated and a 24-hour surface interval before flying is  not always adequate, even if published guidelines or your dive computer  indicates that it should be. These are just estimates and are not a true  reflection of what is occurring in our bodies at any point in time. We need to  always remember this! Dehydration after the diving may well have been a  contributing&nbsp; factor.</p>
	    <p align="justify">John did the right thing by calling the DAN DES Hotline for advice as  soon as he became aware of symptoms. Dr David Wilkinson (the Co-ordinator of  the hotline) took the call, advised John to go to the nearest appropriate  hyperbaric centre and then called me to notify me of the case. I called John  and then linked with the receiving hyperbaric doctor to give him a &ldquo;heads-up&rdquo;  and facilitate prompt assessment and treatment. &nbsp;All went smoothly and a good outcome was  achieved, as expected in this case. &nbsp;<br />
