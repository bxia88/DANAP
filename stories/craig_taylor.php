        <h1>DAN Helped Me </h1>
         
        <p><em>By DAN Asia-Pacific Member Craig Taylor </em></p>
        <h2>The Adventure Begins </h2>
        <p align="justify">Our group of six dive together  every week and had only travelled to Sri Lanka eight weeks earlier to dive the  HMS Hermes. We are all experienced with various levels of tech qualifications.</p>
        <p align="justify">The highlight of our trip to  Honiara was to be our return to the USS Aaron Ward, one of the most spectacular  dives around. It is a destroyer which is sitting upright with guns raised, 20 -  30m visibility, the bottom at 72m, and prolific fish life. </p>
        <h2>Day 1</h2>
        <p align="justify">Two dives, both were easy shore  entries, max depth at 45m, easy deco with no current and heaps of fish. </p>
        <p align="justify">That evening consisted of dinner  and no alcohol. Having been diagnosed with glandular fever only two weeks  earlier I was feeling fine but just aware. The worst of it had been 3.5 weeks  prior to departing for this trip.</p>
        <h2>Day 2</h2>
        <p>I had a good sleep, light  breakfast and plenty of water. </p>
        <p align="justify">The first dive went well. The  dive was to 48m. I left the bottom at 100 bar, switched to gas at 19m, deco  obligations cleared at 53 minutes but stayed nearly an extra 20 minutes longer  at 3m. </p>
        <p align="justify">After a 4 hour surface interval  we undertook the second dive, which was planned to be to 50m. The dive was to  the stern and was a little deeper than expected at 56m. Deco came quicker as it  does on that second dive of the day, I&rsquo;m a little tougher on my air than my  buddies, so at 100 bar I signalled to my buddies I would start my ascent. The  ascent went well with no apparent issues. Bottom time of 18 mins was shorter  than the previous dive but our deco obligations were very close to that dive.  Computers cleared around the 50-minute mark but I stayed approx 15 mins longer  at 3m than required to make sure I was clear.</p>

	    <h2>Then the Trouble Started</h2>
	    <p align="justify"> On boarding the boat I found  conversation hard to understand. There was a full feeling and a tinny echo in  my right ear. I told no one. Was it from a stinger that had entered my ear? There  were plenty at 3m. I tried to shake the water out of it to no avail. I thought  I might have picked up a germ on the morning dive. I had antibiotics at the  hotel so I thought I&rsquo;d be fine by the next day. At dinner things were no  better. We discussed our dive plan for the next day. If I could equalise I  planned to dive. </p>
        <p align="justify">I awoke totally deaf to external  sounds, with the sound of a lightly boiling jug and a mind piercing ringing  inside my ear. At breakfast I explained to the crew my situation, but I still  covered it up well, after all there were no gaping wounds, no blood and no  missing limbs. I was eating and drinking fine. We travelled to Tulagi, site of  the USS Aaron Ward, where I had one hour to ponder my next move. I decided to  dive. When we jumped in I was very conscious of everything: unusual feelings,  twitches or pains on descent. My ears were clear all the way down, not the  slightest twinge. I spent 18 mins at a max depth of 59m. We ascended to  complete our obligations with extra time, headed off to Tulagi for lunch, had a  4.5 hour surface interval and completed two more dives that afternoon with no  equalising issues and no worsening in the condition or symptoms in my ear.</p>
        <p align="justify">It was Wednesday evening. There  was only one more day of diving left before our compulsory no fly interval. In  the evening I rang home and explained as little as possible to my wife, except  for the fact I had a very sore ear and asked that she schedule a doctor&rsquo;s  appointment for me on the Saturday morning of my return. </p>
        <p align="justify">There was no change to my  condition on the last day. However, the guys looked at me strangely when I  asked if they could hear the thunder in an apparently storm free sky. The dives  went well. I descended to 42m with no issues. The shore dives were easy. The  plane trip home was a little painful, even though I could equalise easily. At  this point I was pretty sure I had a serious problem.</p>
        <h2>Back home and straight to the doctor</h2>
        <p align="justify"> During my appointment with our  family doctor he admits that he is out of his depth with my problem. I am  prescribed stronger antibiotics and leave. The next morning the reality of my  problem sinks in. </p>
        <h2>I finally called DAN</h2>
        <p align="justify"> I really do have a problem. I  contact the DAN DES Hotline and I speak with a doctor. Without hesitation he  tells me to rest and advises one of the team will be in touch shortly. It  doesn&rsquo;t look good; he&rsquo;s obviously seen this problem before. Within the hour,  yes Sunday morning, John Lippmann (DAN AP Executive Director) calls and advises  that they will implement a plan. </p>
        <p align="justify">A call comes an hour later. I  will get a referral in the morning for an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT)  Specialist. DAN would track down one with some dive knowledge. At this point  rest is important. If DAN had been contacted urgently after my initial ascent  some of my hearing may have been saved. I receive a call on Monday morning at  9.30am from John. He has already contacted Prince of Wales Hyperbaric Unit.  Unfortunately they don&rsquo;t think there is much they can do at this time and  advised that I be referred to an ENT specialist. John has also short listed me  at two ENT specialists in Sydney where a normal waiting time can be up to two  months. John tells me to wait for a call from one of the ENT&rsquo;s. I am able to  get an appointment on Thursday.</p>
        <p align="justify">The first part of the consultation  questions my experience, dive profile, unusual signs during the dive. The  tuning fork test sort of confirms what we already know. Then I undergo a full  on hearing test. My wife sits in, the technician goes to work on my good left  ear, where things are as normal as they can be after 35 years of surfing,  diving and working in heavy industry. She then switches to my right side:  Nothing. The tests continue but there is nothing in the right side. At the end  of the test I know the result but my wife looks at the technician and asks, &ldquo;Is  everything good?&rdquo; The look on the technician&rsquo;s face speaks volumes as she tells  us she&rsquo;ll get the doctor. The results confirm that I have profound and  permanent hearing loss in the right inner ear possibly due to Vestibular Baratrauma.<em> (For more information please re-visit John Lippmann&rsquo;s  editorial in the latest issue of Alert Diver magazine) </em>I&rsquo;m told I should  question whether I keep diving as the last thing we want is the same thing  happening to my left ear.</p>
        <p align="justify">I visited the Prince of Wales Hyperbaric  Unit and was advised by Professor Michael Bennett that I had a rare type of  injury as a result of using air at 
          50%, one often associated with the use of Trimix. The chances of it happening  again 
          would have to be very small, though not impossible. Had we got there earlier a  trial in the chamber may have been an option. </p>
        <h2>A Changed Life</h2>
        <p align="justify"> The word &lsquo;deaf&rsquo; does not describe  what's going on. It's not silence, I wish it were. I have an incessant squeal  in my head that appears to come from my bad ear; it never gives in. </p>
        <p align="justify">Shopping centres, restaurants,  work, and the compressor all amplify the squeal. Conversation is virtually  impossible in some places. They say it should settle down over time. I hope  they are right. <br />
            <br />
          My family (wife Made and two daughters Riani, 18 and Dewi, 6) seem to be 
          adapting: poking fun and laughing when I look the wrong way to talk to 
          them, or when I occasionally put the phone to my bad ear. </p>
        <p align="justify">Work is tough as a construction  supervisor, factory noise is much more intense with one ear, I find I don&rsquo;t  involve myself in general conversation as much as I did previously. I just get  the job done. There is also the feeling of being down a little, withdrawal  effects I suppose from not diving for a month. I stay in touch with the crew,  visit the dive shop. Not diving is just not the same.</p>
        <h2>Why Did it Happen?</h2>
        <p align="justify"> The dives I completed were not  any different to the 50 or so dives I&rsquo;ve completed beyond 40m, or the 150 or so  deco dives I&rsquo;ve undertaken in recent years. Safe gases were used, analysed,  switched at the right depth, algorithms followed and extra time at 3m always  undertaken. Yet this still happened. </p>
        <h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
        <p align="justify"> Quite simply the moral of my  story is that I should have stopped diving immediately. I should have expressed  my serious concerns to my buddies and not toughed it out. <span class="style1">I definitely should  have contacted DAN upon surfacing when I knew there was a problem; as should  any diver who surfaces with &ldquo;something&rdquo; that&rsquo;s just not right. </span></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>When I finally called DAN, the  response was fast, the advice right. DAN&rsquo;s knowledge and contacts in the  medical world are second to none; even my GP could not believe how fast things  moved.</strong></p>
        <h2>Back in the Water &hellip;</h2>
        <p align="justify">I couldn't hold back any longer.  Six weeks out of the water was enough! I suppose things weren't going to get  any worse. The damage is permanent. The first dive to 21m I took slowly,  feeling for anything out of the ordinary. Equalising was fine, no adverse  symptoms. I left the water feeling relieved that nothing went wrong and a  little more confident. Since then I&rsquo;ve completed about 10 dives. Most in that  depth range with one deco dive to 40m, which went well. <br />
            <br />
          I'll continue to dive, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to ascend a little slower and spend  even more time at deco than required to reduce any problems. I&rsquo;m a little more  wary and a lot more careful.</p>
        <p align="justify">Again thanks to John, the DAN DES consulting doctor  (Dr David Wilkinson), SA Ambulance and everyone else who has had to put up with  me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d especially like to thank my poor  family who try to maintain my sense of humour and keep me up at a time where  circumstances seem to pull me down as I adapt to the injury.</p>
        <h2>Comment by John Lippmann (DAN AP Executive Director)</h2>
        <p align="justify">The above case highlights the importance of seeking  specialist diving medical advice as soon as symptoms develop. Although it can  sometimes be very difficult to differentiate between inner ear and middle ear barotrauma,  decompression illness, and certain other disorders, a specialist can make a  provisional diagnosis and advise the best course of action based on the likely  problems and the severity of the symptoms. Sometimes permanent injury may be  unavoidable but on other occasions, quick action can minimise the likelihood of  permanent hearing or balance problems.</p>
        <p align="justify">In this case the diagnosis differed between various  doctors (which is not unusual with inner ear disorders) but the end result was  the same due to the delays and possibly the continued diving.</p>
        Craig is a passionate  diver and has decided to continue diving. He needs to be really careful not to  damage his good ear or he will be in bigger trouble. He is well aware of this  and has chosen to dive cautiously to minimise the risk. <br />
