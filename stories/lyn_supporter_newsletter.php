        <h1>DAN Was There For Me </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN Asia-Pacific Member, Lyn (Australia) </em></p>
        <h3><em>          Continued from August 2012 Supporter Newsletter </em></h3>
        <h2>It&rsquo;s Definitely Not a Bend</h2>
        <p align="justify">Our initial reaction to these symptoms was that it was possibly a bend although it didn&rsquo;t really match anything we had heard of and my diving profiles didn&rsquo;t seem particularly excessive. Nevertheless, we sought advice from our divemaster and even suggested to her that some immediate oxygen might be beneficial. After viewing my rash, her advice was that it was not a bend and was probably due to an allergic reaction to something. As I had consumed some unfamiliar seafood at lunchtime, this explanation seemed to be plausible and as relatively inexperienced divers (around 50 dives), we relied on her experience and went along with her advice to &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo;.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/rash_lyn.jpg" width="283" height="212" /></p>
        <p align="justify">By the time the divemaster returned from the next dive the rash was now dark red and had become very painful both to touch and body movement; although the itching had subsided somewhat. As we were both now having doubts about her advice, my husband decided to ask the captain (also a divemaster) to take a look and again suggested oxygen. Unfortunately he was even more definite that it wasn&rsquo;t a bend, and told us he had seen it before and it was definitely an allergic reaction. Again, although doubtful, we allowed ourselves to be persuaded to &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Emergency Oxygen Cylinder: Empty!</h2>
        <p align="justify">On Tuesday morning, although the rash was improved I still had some pain so my husband spoke again to the captain and suggested that although it might not be a bend, that some oxygen &lsquo;was worth a try, just in case&rsquo;. The captain agreed to this. It was discovered that their &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; oxygen cylinder was empty so some was decanted from their Nitrox supply. I spent around an hour breathing 100% oxygen. I improved a little more during the day, although it wasn&rsquo;t immediate enough to be clearly attributable to the oxygen.</p>
        <p align="justify">          It was on this day we discovered that two of the other divers aboard were doctors. They heard about my problem and asked to examine me. The doctors were unable to give any definite diagnosis although a bend was considered one possibility and their advice was to continue not to dive.<br />
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/lyn_oxygen.jpg" width="170" height="223" /></p>
        <h2>Fit to Dive? </h2>
        <p align="justify">I was quite a bit better on Wednesday and by Thursday morning the rash had all but disappeared and I had only slight pain. Due, no doubt, to wishful thinking, we convinced ourselves that it had probably been some sort of allergy as the ships crew had insisted. Any passing thought given to the slight remaining pain that worsened on movement explained it away as probably just a muscle strain. Foolishly, we decided I was fit to continue diving although we at least showed a little sense in deciding to stay shallow. The captain and divemaster were quite comfortable, even encouraging, with this decision although the doctors expressed their misgivings.</p>
        <p align="justify">          Consequently on Thursday I undertook three dives, each around 50 mins. It was great to be back in the water! We dived with the rest of the group but when the others descended the wall, we stayed relatively shallow to a maximum depth of 18 m.</p>
        <h2>Last Day: Symptoms Return </h2>
	    <p align="justify">Happily, I felt fine that evening and on Friday I fronted up for the final day of diving. That day I did all four dives on offer for around 50 mins each but again I restricted myself in depth and did not exceed 20m. It was during the post dive drinks that I started to again feel nauseous. When my skin also began prickling it was now quite obvious the symptoms had re-occurred and that the diving was the cause.</p>
	    <p align="justify">	      Unbelievably, when we reported this to the captain and asked for more oxygen, he still insisted it was not a bend! He suggested a number of possibilities, such as an allergy again, a pulled muscle, a too tight wetsuit: Basically anything (and everything) but a bend. By now, however, we had finally woken up to the possible seriousness of the situation and insisted on immediate oxygen. Plus, we would call to DAN as soon as we were within phone range early that evening. </p>
	    <h2>Why We Didn't Call DAN Sooner</h2>
        <p>There were a number of reasons why we hadn&rsquo;t made that call until then. <br />
          <br />
          1.	We were being told by people, whose expertise we were relying on, that I wasn&rsquo;t bent. <br />
          2.	We felt that we had some backup given there were doctors on board who could step in if things got worse.<br />
          3.	We had thought it &ldquo;too big a step&rsquo; when we weren&rsquo;t even sure it was a bend. We had read many cases published by DAN where heroic measures were taken to evacuate and treat bent cases. We were worried if we rang that the doctors might just cover themselves and insist on expensive and inconvenient evacuation and treatment just to be sure. </p>
        <p>          I&rsquo;m pleased to say our concerns were entirely unfounded. We made that call and after a short discussion with an on-call doctor, we were soon phoned back by John Lippmann, the Executive Director of DAN AP. <br />
          After all the worry it was wonderful to be able to speak with such a friendly, reassuring, and most importantly, expert person. John didn&rsquo;t make us feel foolish for not having rung earlier and his advice was entirely proportionate. While not underplaying the situation, he explained that although it was definitely a &lsquo;skin bend&rsquo;, at this time the risk of any serious complications was minimal. It was worth the phone call just to hear that! He advised that I should breathe pure oxygen for as long as possible that night until the boat returned to port on the Saturday.</p>
        <p>          John suggested that the best thing would be to visit the nearby hospital and chamber on disembarking the boat but when we explained our concern at probably missing our international flight he gave us an alternative. Our flight to Kuala Lumpur was not until Saturday night so we could see how the symptoms went after the overnight oxygen and during the course of the next day. If all seemed well, we could make a choice to risk the short flight to KL and if any symptoms reoccurred on the flight we could go straight to the chamber on arrival. If no symptoms reoccurred we were probably fine to catch our international flight on Monday night.</p>
        <p>          As it happens, this is the course we took. I was feeling good after the overnight oxygen and we caught the flight to KL and then back home without incident. Amazingly, John rang me the next morning and also on my arrival in KL to check on my wellbeing! </p>
        <h2>Comment by John Lippmann, DAN AP Executive Director </h2>
        <p>It really comes as no great surprise to me to hear of Lyn&rsquo;s initial problems arising after her second morning of diving where she did three 50-minute dives to around 30 m in close succession. These dives would accumulate quite a lot of inert gas and relatively little time to eliminate this, despite the dive computer indicating that all is OK. </p>
        <p>It was a sensible action to refrain from diving and the divemaster/skipper should have readily provided oxygen to her and a DAN hotline should have been promptly contacted for advice, as Lyn now knows. </p>
        <h2>Lesson's for Dive Operators </h2>
        <p><strong>1. Do not take it upon yourself to diagnose a diving client. </strong><br />
        As a diving professional your first step should be to call DAN and speak to an expert as soon as there is a concern about a diver. The Diving Doctor will review the dives undertaken (depths, safety stops, conditions, surface intervals) and symptoms the diver is exhibiting. You will get prompt, friendly and expert advice. </p>
        <p>          It is inappropriate and unwise for a divemaster/skipper to try to withhold oxygen because they do not think a diver is suffering from DCI. Fortunately, Lyn did not deteriorate badly, but she potentially could have, especially with further diving, which can sometimes turn a mild DCI into a very serious one unless very well-managed. </p>
        <p>          <strong>2. Ensure you have properly maintained oxygen equipment available for diving emergencies on all your dive boats</strong>. It must be capable of supplying near-100% oxygen to a breathing diver by both a demand valve and a high concentration constant flow mask (e.g. non-rebreather mask). It should also be capable of supplying at least 50% oxygen to a non-breathing diver. In addition, there must be an adequate supply to give high concentration oxygen to the diver until medical aid is available. </p>
        <p>          Remember, immediate provision of oxygen is vital. Ensure your tanks actually have oxygen in them.</p>
        <p>          <strong>3.	Ensure there is staff on-board your dive boat/s trained and currently competent in oxygen provision, basic first aid and CPR. </strong>Ensure your staff practices their skills so they can effectively assist in an emergency situation. </p>
        <p>          <strong>4. Have an Emergency Plan that includes:</strong><br />
          -	A prompt call being made to a DAN Hotline for advice (have the numbers readily available).<br />
          -	Immediate provision of basic life support and first aid is provided.<br />
        -	You have knowledge of the local medical centres and suitable chambers.</p>
