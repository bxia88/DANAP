        <h1>The Honeymoon Death Chronicle </h1>
        <p><em>By Dr Carl Edmonds </em></p>
        <p align="justify">The following case report is described  chronologically - but, how it was presented to me and most other interested  divers, not how it actually happened. </p>
        <h2>The Official Version </h2>
        <p align="justify">The first information came from the news  media, paper and TV. An American was under suspicion of murdering his wife on a  scuba diving expedition on the famed <em>Yongala</em> wreck, off Townsville, Queensland, on 22nd October 2003.</p>
        <p align="justify">In 2010, the media and police reports  were followed by a 2-part series on the national TV, ABC's Australian Story,  titled <em>Unfathomable</em>. All characters  depicted in the presentation, except for the academic lawyer who expressed no  opinion, gave evidence supportive of the police view on how the murder was  committed.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Townsville police, who were not  divers and had no knowledge of scuba diving, proudly boasted of their  achievements and perseverance, and concluded that Gabe Watson murdered Tina,  his wife of 11 days.&nbsp; The even received  police commendation medals for their efforts. Why were they suspicious? They  explained their reasons both in court and to an avaricious media. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>He would collect her insurance money and  her other assets </li>
          <li>The observations of two experienced  American divers on the boat, who listened to Gabe's story. Both responded with  &quot;Bullshit, it could not have happened that way&quot;. They re-iterated  this statement in the news media, the TV documentary, the Coroner's Inquest  and, in February 2012, the court in Alabama.</li>
          <li>Gabe's lies about his dive computer (DC)  malfunctioning. Gabe claimed that when he and his wife followed the group of  divers for their first dive attempt, at a depth of 1 metre, his computer  indicated that there was a problem, by beeping. This allowed him to abort the  dive and return to the dive boat, thereby escaping the attention of the other  divers and isolating Tina from them. The police checked the computer and found  that it did not beep under the conditions of the aborted dive (1 metre depth,  battery inserted incorrectly).</li>
          <li>Gabe did not mention any problems with  his ears during the initial interview, but later mentioned it. The original  omission was regarded as suspicious. It could be used as an explanation for his  subsequent actions.</li>
          <li>Gabe's claim, that he was able to replace  his mask and mouthpiece after Tina had displaced them during her attempted  return to the safety of a descent line. This was considered improbable.</li>
          <li>The observation of Dr Stutz, who was  descending down the line when Gabe and Tina were returning to it, stated that  Gabe had Tina in a &quot;bear-hug&quot; (at a depth of about 12 metres and near  the descent line), before letting her sink to the sea bed at about 27 metres.</li>
          <li>Gabe deserted his wife after about 5  minutes of the dive and carried out a slow and &quot;pedestrian&quot; ascent to  the surface without her. They contrasted this to the rapid ascent made by her  subsequent rescuer, dive instructor Wade Singleton. </li>
          <li>Gabe was a qualified rescue diver. Why  did he not rescue Tina?</li>
          <li>Gabe's claim that he tried to communicate  and enlist help from some Asians on the line during his ascent. This was not  supported, even though the police allegedly interviewed all the divers.</li>
          <li>Gabe gave many different versions of the  event. </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">The police then explained the <em>modus operandi</em> of the murder. The motive  was her money (insurance claim, assets). He arranged a trip to the <em>Yongala</em>, then used the ploy of a  malfunctioning computer to separate Tina and him from the other divers in the  first group. They joined another group for the second dive attempt. They left  the descent line at about 12 metres (as did everyone else), but swam away from  the others so that he could turn off her air supply without being noticed.  After she had died or lost consciousness, he approached her from the front (the  bear-hug), turned the air supply back on, then let her sink to the bottom as he  made his leisurely way to the surface. </p>
        <p align="justify">She thus died of asphyxia (obstruction of  the air supply, suffocation) and Gabe was charged with murder. </p>
        <p align="justify">The Coroner, David Glasgow,  delivered his findings in 2008, thatthe main ones which were that Tina Watson  drowned and &ldquo;that a properly instructed jury, could make a finding of guilt  against David Gabriel Watson on a charge of Murder. The Attorney General  subsequently decided against imposing this murder charge at the court hearing  in Townsville, and accepted a manslaughter plea based on negligence (duty of  care, failure to rescue a buddy diver). Gabe received a 12 months sentence,  later converted to 18 months, in Australia and then extradited to USA where he  faced another murder charge and life imprisonment, in Birmingham, Alabama, in  Feb 2012. <br />
          <br />
          There were many other rumours, salacious  suggestions, media trivia, etc., unrelated to the dive, and most of which were  either disproven, hearsay or not verified, and so are not pursued further. </p>
        <h2>The Facts </h2>
        <p align="justify">In mid 2011 I was enticed into this  situation when asked by a reporter and co-author&nbsp; of <em>Honeymoon Dive</em>, to  explain certain problems that she had with the events as described above. I  gradually collected a great deal of information over the next few months, all  of which was official and somewhere on the public record (the Coroner's Inquest  transactions and witness statements, autopsy reports, post-mortem CT scans,  signed police statements, videos of official interviews, DC printouts, recorded  ascent rates, tank pressures before and after the dive, the sea state  (underwater currents especially), equipment testing results and gas  analysis.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">Both Michael McFadyen (an experienced and  high-profile Australian diver) and I were asked independently to review the  details of the incident. Our conclusions were almost identical. In describing  the dive, I have added notes to explain to less experienced investigators, the  probable reasons and explanations for the events that occurred.</p>
        <h2>The Dive  </h2>
        <p>The dive, as described by Gabe Watson, Dr  Stutz, Wade Singleton, other divers (validated by DC profiles from Gabe, Tina  and Wade's computers) was as follows:</p>
        <p>On 22 Oct 2003, Gabe and Tina Watson  dived on the <em>Yongala</em>, one of the most  popular dive sites on the reef, chosen by Gabe from diving articles and web  sites in the USA.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/yongala_diagram.jpg" width="400" height="180" /></p>
	    <p align="justify">Tina was a nervous, novice  diver and was over-weighted with 9 kg weights. This was twice as much as  indicated by her equipment and twice as much as used by the other female  divers.<em>(1)</em> She had less than 10 short dives logged,  no experience of diving against currents or in the open ocean, or at depths  greater than 10 metres, and had previously panicked during diver training (in a  still-water quarry) and again after the first immersion on the day of the <em>Yongala</em> dive.</p>
	    <p align="justify">Nor, it appears, did Gabe have much experience  of these conditions. Although he had logged over 50 dives, he had experienced  drift diving in Cozumel<em>.(2)</em>	      Both divers appeared very inexperienced  for the <em>Yongala</em> dive (a  &quot;red&quot; dive), which can be very variable, demanding and unpredictable. </p>
	    <p align="justify">They dived unsupervised, but based on Gabe&rsquo;s  alleged experience, even though possibly offered supervision<em>.(3) </em></p>
	    <p align="justify">Tina and Gabe descended a metre or so,  but then experienced DC trouble. Gabe explained that the DC had sounded a  warning alarm, indicating malfunction. They ascended, (allegedly out of breath  and anxious), re-adjusted the DC battery, refilled their tanks and recommenced  the dive.</p>
	    <p align="justify">They descended slowly and uneventfully  down the line, for the first 4 minutes, admiring the fish. There was a group of  divers preceding them and another group including the dive supervisor,  following them. There were somewhere near 12-15 divers within a relatively  short distance. All were in visibility range.</p>
	    <p align="justify">After 4 minutes they  arrived at 12 m, when Tina and Gabe left the rope. This is when the combined  effects of Tina's negative buoyancy {over-weighted, now by about 7 Kg<em>(4)</em>} and the very significant current, would  have had their effects. These would have caused Tina to sink and be swept away  from the descent line. Her panic was understandable. </p>
	    <p align="justify">They were not able to see the proposed ascent  line at the other end of the wreck. Tina indicated that she wanted to return to  the rope, where they could see figures. Gabe felt likewise. They decided to  turn around and swim back to the descent line, which they equated with safety  and ascent to their dive boat - but against the current and with Gabe assisting  Tina. There appeared to be panic behaviour by both.<em>(5)  </em></p>
	    <p align="justify">Gabe had attempted to get  Tina to inflate her BC, but her attempt was brief and ineffectual<em>.(6)</em> This made Gabe worry that Tina may have  had other problems, equipment or personal.</p>
	    <p align="justify">It was during this 4-5th minute period, with  Tina hyperventilating from both exertion and panic, that she would have  over-breathed the regulator, inhaled salt water through and around the  mouthpiece.<em>(7)  </em></p>
	    <p align="justify">Gabe was trying to assist  Tina but, being so close, he had his mask displaced by her hand movements, and  lost his mouthpiece (1st stage regulator).<em>(8) </em>Sensibly, Gabe backed off from Tina,  rearranged his mask and replaced this regulator with his emergency one (octopus  reg). Tina was then sinking and drifting away with the current, probably  unconscious from the hypoxia. Gabe swam down towards her. </p>
	    <p align="justify">This is when Dr Shultz (who was with  10-15 divers) saw Tina, alone and in distress. Dr Stutz&rsquo; testified that he saw  Gabe swimming towards her, apparently trying to rescue her. The absence of  bubbles indicated that she had stopped breathing.</p>
	    <p align="justify">After some seconds (5-10) Gabe separated from  her and ascended as Tina sank to the bottom, 5 min after the start of the dive.  Gabe, who admitted to be panicking himself, claimed that he was concerned that  if they tried a direct ascent, they could be distant from assistance (their dive  boat). He had already tried to tow her to the descent rope, and failed<em>.(9)</em>	      The maximum depth they reached was just  over 16 metres.        </p>
	    <p align="justify">Gabe thus decided to ascend and get help.  He claimed to have reached the rope by swimming very fast, which he would have  to do against the current, at a 45 degree angle. He attempted to communicate  with an Asian diver, but got no response and so continued up the rope at a fast  rate to summon assistance.</p>
	    <p align="justify">As Gabe surfaced, Wade Singleton, who was  diving on the wreck, found Tina on the sea bed at 27 metres depth, 10 metres  distant from the wreck. She was not breathing, had her regulator in place and  her mask on, BC deflated and air tank turned on (noted subsequently). She was  brought to the surface by Wade, who ditched his own weights to get buoyancy and  probably had the expanding air in his BC to assist. He purged air into Tina  through her regulator, while on the sea bed and occasionally during the fast  ascent.</p>
	    <p align="justify">On surfacing, Tina was seen to have blood  escaping from her mouth and on another dive boat she was given oxygen  resuscitation for 40 minutes by 2 experienced American emergency ward  physicians. Large amounts of froth and some water was produced, but the  resuscitation was unsuccessful.</p>
	    <p align="center"><img src="_images/gabes_ascent_curve.jpg" width="240" height="300" /></p>
        <h2>Investigations</h2>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Autopsy</strong>.&nbsp; The cause of death, according to the forensic Pathologist,  Professor David Williams, was drowning.<em>(10)</em></p>
        <p align="justify">Extensive air embolism was also present,  in both arterial and venous systems, and this was said to have occurred when  there was still an active vascular circulation. </p>
        <p align="justify">Post mortem CT scans also revealed  sphenoidal and other sinus opacities, indicating descent whist unconscious but  alive, and bilateral pneumothoraces.</p>
        <p>A more clinical diving medical assessment  would be:</p>
        <p>1. Aspiration, Hypoxia and then  Drowning&nbsp;&nbsp; (not Asphyxia)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported  by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lungs at autopsy</li>
          <li>Froth ++ on surfacing and during  resuscitation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Predisposing causes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Panic, personality factors</li>
          <li>Over-weighted</li>
          <li>Exertion and over breathing the regulator</li>
          <li>Inexperience in the diving environment  (currents, depth)</li>
          <li>Salt water aspiration leading to hypoxia  and drowning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Air Embolism from Pulmonary  Barotrauma.<br />
          Supported by autopsy and post-mortem CT  scan findings of excessive gas</p>
        <ul>
          <li>bilateral pneumothoraces.</li>
          <li>Gas in arterial system</li>
          <li>Blood coming out of her mouth or nose</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Predisposing factors</p>
        <ul>
          <li>rapid ascent </li>
          <li>positive pressure from the purge valve of  the regulator. </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">The dive profile, the amount of gas and  its distribution indicated that other explanations, such as putrefaction or  post-mortem decompression artefact (off-gassing) were inadequate to explain the  above findings, without pulmonary barotrauma and air embolism. </p>
        <h2><strong>DC  and Tank Pressure Data</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">Although limited in detail,  the DC validated the above depths and durations quoted. Gabe's DC disclosed a  very rapid ascent rate, once he succeeded against the current<em>(11)</em> and reached the descent line, as did  Singleton's DC.</p>
        <p align="justify">The air pressures remaining in the scuba  tanks indicated an extra-ordinary air consumption by Tina. She had used almost  600 Litres in under 5.5 minutes and even allowing for air loss, this is a  maximum minute volume of about 100 l/min, with an average depth adjustment to  about 50 l/min. If the tank had been turned off for 2 minutes, her air  consumption would have had to be more than 120 l/min, considering her dive  profile in the first 3 minutes (when things were going well). This would have  changed her air consumption from extremely exceptional to impossible.</p>
        <p align="justify">Gabe's DC also revealed near maximal  recorded air consumption during the latter part of his 7+ minute dive,  verifying his claim of very fast swimming.</p>
        <h2>Re-enactments</h2>
        <p align="justify">The police performed a series of what  they called re-enactments, which impressed the Australian Coroner and the  media. But these did not comply with the most basic requirements of such  activities. They were trying to demonstrate that their <em>modus operandi</em> was possible and that Gabe therefore could have  murdered Tina. Although accepted by the Australian Coroner, Judge Nail  disallowed them for a number of very valid reasons. They did not reflect the  conditions of the fatal dive regarding currents, buoyancy, personnel skills or  equipment used. They were less re-enactments, than acting-out of fantasies.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">Jurisprudence</h2>
        <p align="justify">Even though the police have never  retracted any of their accusations, their reasons for suspecting murder were  all fallacious.</p>
        <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Gabe was not the beneficiary of Tina's  insurance policy, her father was. Her liabilities and debts&nbsp; exceeded her assets by over $20 000, which  Gabe had to pay.</li>
          <li>The observations of the two  &quot;expert&quot; American divers, essentially calling Gabe a liar, were made  within minutes of Tina's accident. All without knowledge of the DC dive  profile, Gabe and Tina's&nbsp; inexperience,  the autopsy reports, ascent rates adjusted for currents and over-weighting of  Tina, the air consumption of Tina and Gabe, and the evidence of others (Stutz,  Johnston, Downie etc.). They had never investigated diving deaths, apparently  knew nothing about the statistics of diving fatalities and kept making the most  astounding basic errors in diving physiology. Nevertheless, they probably  influenced the gullible police investigators, the media, the Coroner and most  reprehensible of all, Tina's family - who they contacted to share their views.</li>
          <li>Gabe's &quot;lies&quot; about his  computer malfunctioning were demonstrated by the Oceanic (DC) manufacturer's  representative, to be true. There were a number of reasons for the DC  performing as it did, with Gabe's explanation being one of them. </li>
          <li>Gabe did have middle ear barotrauma of  descent from both diving and aviation. The otological findings of haemorrhage  in the tympanic membrane was verified by a competent diving physician after the  dive, and an aviation medico after a flight. </li>
          <li>Gabe's claim that he was able to replace  his mask and mouthpiece after Tina had displaced them during her panic before  they separated, was not improbable. Indeed, any diver trainee is taught this.  It was incredible that the police diver failed to achieve this in the  re-enactments.</li>
          <li>The observation of Dr Stutz, claiming  that Gabe had Tina in a &quot;bear-hug&quot;, was simply untrue. He did use  this term later, to describe Singleton's grip on Tina during ascent. He was  horrified to find that his observations were applied to Gabe and used to  support a charge of murder. He saw no evidence for this. He thought Gabe was  trying to rescue Tina.</li>
          <li>Gabe did desert his wife after about 5  minutes, when he was unable to tow her to the descent line, against a moderate  to severe current, her over-weighting and her vertical body drag. To reach the  rope and then surface he had to swim extremely hard, when considering the  estimated current that he swam against. The DC and his air consumption  supported this, and his ascent rate was fully comparable to the direct ascent  by Singleton. Gabe attempted to rescue Tina by getting her to the descent rope.  If he had succeeded in this it is likely, or at least possible, that she could  have been surfaced and resuscitated from a near-drowning state. </li>
          <li>Singleton took Tina rapidly to the  surface and inadvertently caused the air embolism that guaranteed resuscitation  would be impossible without a recompression chamber. Both Gabe and Wade did  their best to rescue Tina. Neither succeeded.</li>
          <li>Gabe's practical experience as a rescue  diver comprised one rehearsed rescue, 4 years previously, of a non-overweight  buddy, not in danger, in a quarry without any current. This is not an  &quot;experienced&quot; rescue diver.</li>
          <li>Gabe claimed that he tried to communicate  and enlist help from some Asians on the line during his ascent. According to  the Coroner's Inquest proceedings, the police did not interview or receive  confirmation from both Koreans that this contact did not happen. </li>
          <li>Gabe was said to have given many  different versions of the event. I have perused his witness statements and his  prolonged video interviews. His observations were not only consistent, but  complied with his DC profile as well as the factual documentation that was not  considered by the police (Gabe's swim against currents, his recorded ascent  rate and his air consumption). His interpretations of the problems, at the request  of his interviewers, may not have shown such consistency, as his diving  expertise was not much more than theirs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>On Feb 23rd 2012, Judge Nail dismissed  the case without even hearing the defense. He stated that the prosecution's  evidence was based on conjecture and speculation.</p>
        <h2><strong>The  Logic of the Original Police Hypotheses</strong></h2>
        <p>Logic and reason could have played a part  in preventing this speculation.</p>
        <p align="justify">Why would a scuba diver, who wishes to  murder his buddy, travel half way around the world to dive on one of the most  popular sites on the Great Barrier Reef. There is a bevy of other divers always  within sight at this commercial dive site, able to come to the rescue and where  police inquiries and Coroners Inquests are inevitable. Why not the Caribbean or  Mexico, where none of these need apply.</p>
        <p align="justify">If Gabe wanted to isolate himself and  Tina, why would he dive in the front of his group, with at least two groups  behind him, watching, and another group in front.</p>
        <p align="justify">If he wanted to get Tina away from the  others, to kill her, what was he doing at the end of the dive, within a few  metres of the descent line and its 10-15 attached divers? He had managed to  bring her back towards possible safety and potential rescue (the line and its  divers), not away from it.</p>
        <p align="justify">If Gabe wanted to turn the air supply on  or off, he (like all others who have done this in training procedures) would do  it from behind.</p>
        <p align="justify">A quick chat to a forensic pathologist  would have disclosed that obstruction of an air supply (asphyxia), even on the  surface, would not have caused unconsciousness in the time available. Further  consultation with a diving physician would have added that the increased oxygen  pressure at depth would have considerably extended that time needed to lose  consciousness.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
          Why did not the police or the Coroner  listen to the experts that they had available and question them on the possible  causes of Tina's common but tragic drowning? Dr Griffiths, Dr Thomas and dive  accident investigator Chris Coxon were all available and knowledgeable.&nbsp; Actually, Dr Griffiths did try to explain  the cause of Tina's death, but was given little or no credence by the police or  the Coroner.&nbsp; Anyone who claimed that  there was no reason for Tina to have drowned, has little or no understanding of  scuba diving fatalities.</p>
        <p align="justify">Tina died from drowning and/or air  embolism - the two commonest causes of diving fatalities. She had both. The  question of why Tina died was easy to answer, and now has been. The more  difficult one is: How did this case get so out of hand that a grieving husband  and a despairing family can have their lives torn apart by such an incompetent  investigation? </p>

        <h2>Notes </h2>
        <p align="justify">1. This would make her negatively  buoyant, unless countered by inflation of her small and inadequate buoyancy  compensator. Using excess weights is common in novice or anxious divers, to  assist in descent. This over-weighting was verified by subsequent events.</p>
        <p align="justify"> 2. Drift diving with currents is almost  effortless and the opposite to diving against currents, which&nbsp; requires physical and aquatic fitness,  neutral buoyancy, a horizontal body position to reduce drag,&nbsp; and experience.</p>
        <p align="justify"> 3. Novice or anxious divers, like Tina,  often prefer to dive with their known more experienced buddy &ndash; her new husband  in this case. In my opinion, both divers required supervision by a diving  instructor as both were entering into conditions for which they were  ill-equipped, un-trained and inexperienced in an environment unknown to them.</p>
        <p align="justify"> 4. Calculated from the 9 kg weights,  the 3mm wet suit, and the effect of Boyles Law on both her wet suit and body  gas spaces. There was never any evidence of buoyancy compensator (BC) use by  Tina&nbsp; once descent had commenced. The  over-weight would have assisted her in an easy descent whilst hanging on the  line. Her BC was later observed to be empty.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify"> 5.  Tina was overweighted, and so in a non-horizontal body position, swimming  against a current estimated as moderate to severe by 15 of the 19 divers that  morning.&nbsp; This attempted return to the  descent line is verified by Dr Stutz's observations, as he identified Tina  clearly near the end of the 5 minutes, close to the descent rope, but at about  12-15 metres depth.</p>
        <p align="justify">6. Most novice divers, and even more  experienced ones, are usually not aware of the relative slowness of inflating  BCs at depth, and this is especially so in panic situations.</p>
        <p align="justify">          <strong>7. Salt water aspiration</strong> contributes to  37% of the diving fatalities, and leads to hypoxia as the blood is not  adequately oxygenated (due to the sea water and oedema in the lungs). This  progresses to a confusional state, unconsciousness and near-drowning, then  death from drowning. Struggling may be present during this procedure, but often  it is either ineffectual or absent. <br />
          This is very different to <strong>asphyxia</strong> from obstruction of an air  supply, in which accumulation of carbon dioxide induces severe and purposeful  struggling to re-establish the air supply. </p>
        <p align="justify"> 8.  Later it was observed that the rubber part of the mouthpiece was missing. It  had separated from the regulator.</p>
        <p align="justify"> 9.  Probably due to the current, Tina's over-weighting causing her to sink, her  body position (more vertical due to the over-weighting and so causing excess  drag) and her inability to assist due to hypoxia and her near-drowning state.</p>
        <p align="justify">10.  This &quot;drowning&quot; diagnosis was modified to &quot;Asphyxia&quot; by  both the Australian judiciary and police, presumably to support a conviction of  death from cessation of an air supply (a forensic description of asphyxia).  This was not accepted by Judge Nail in Atlanta, who correctly adhered to the  pathologist's diagnosis of drowning. The lung weights and histology were  characteristic of drowning, not simple asphyxia.</p>
        <p align="justify">11. The &quot;moderate to  severe&quot; current, as quoted in the police reports, was probably somewhere  between half and one knot. That means a swimmer is carried away at 15-30 metres  per minute. To achieve any headway against the current, therefore, he must swim  faster than this.</p>
