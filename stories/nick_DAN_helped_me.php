        <h1>DAN Was There For Me </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN Asia-Pacific Nick Amidy </em></p>
        <h3><em>          Continued from Deeper with DAN Issue 20 </em></h3>
        <h2>Time to Visit the Doctor </h2>
        <p align="justify">That day, after spending most of  the morning alternating between the bed and the toilet, I decided it was a good  idea to go and see a doctor. I was starting to consider a broader set of  possibilities as to the nature of my problem.<strong> </strong>I  wanted to be tested for Malaria. The test proved negative and the doctor  laughed at me and told me I was simply acclimatising to the bacteria in  Vanuatu. I was told to go home and sleep it off!</p>
        <p align="justify">As I deteriorated other  possibilities started to enter my head, including the underwater environment.  </p>
        <p align="justify">At the same time Amelia had managed to get bilateral ear infections even after diligently  washing her ears post dive, so she was suffering at the same time. </p>
        <h2 align="justify">Appendicitis?</h2>
        <p align="justify">Lying on my bed, the pain started  to become intolerable. I had Amelia, who was in severe pain from her well-established ear infections, push on my stomach to try and isolate the  pain. Suddenly I found a spot just inside my right hipbone. I did a rebound  test, which involves pushing in deep at the site and then letting go quickly to  see if there was a sharp, severe pain, which would indicate Appendicitis. I  quickly Googled the signs and symptoms: pain, loss of appetite, fever, nausea,  upset bowels, migrating abdominal pain. I had ticks in all these boxes.</p>
        <p align="justify">So off we went to the Emergency  Department. I was given an ultrasound and a mass was detected. A doctor also  conducted a rebound test and diagnosed appendicitis. But after receiving some  test results the doctor started to change his mind and instead diagnosed a  urinary tract infection. He said triumphantly. <em>&ldquo;No appendicitis. I think.  Not sure!&rdquo; </em></p>
        <p align="justify">After further discussions, the  doctors came to the conclusion that a laparotomy (major abdominal incision) to  remove the (possibly) offending appendix the next morning would be &ldquo;quick and  easy&rdquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just appendicitis mate,&rdquo; said the young doctor. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about  it: 15 minute job, 30mg of Morphine and you won&rsquo;t worry about a thing! This was  all fine but I knew the major risk stemmed from post-op infections. And if I  was going to contract an infection it would almost certainly be in the hot,  muggy conditions of the surgery theatre. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Luckily I had a very patient John Lippmann (DAN) on the other end of  the phone giving me advice. He told me to keep him posted to the minute, and  that he had the power to evacuate me if I felt like my safety and wellbeing  wasn&rsquo;t being taken with utmost consideration at any stage.</strong> He told me not  to let it get too bad before making the decision.</p>
       
        <h2>Get Me Out of Here! </h2>
        <p align="justify">I called my travel insurance  company and was patched through to someone in the UK, who sounded bored and  promised she&rsquo;d give me a call back as I was running out of credit and battery  power on my phone. After an hour of waiting in considerable pain, and not being  able to get hold of them, I called John back and said <em>&ldquo;<strong>Get me out of here</strong>&rdquo;.</em></p>
        <p align="justify">John commenced evacuation  procedures and called me back an hour later to say that the plane would be on  the tarmac at approximately 4:00am. Now that was incredible efficiency. I later  received a call from Dr Allan MacKillop, Chief Medical Officer with Careflight  Queensland, who asked me for a rundown, and upon hearing it diagnosed  appendicitis before ensuring me that the end was in sight. I nearly collapsed  with relief. </p>
         <p align="center"><img src="_images/nick_tarmac.jpg" width="227" height="285" /></p>
		<p align="justify">Sitting on the runway waiting to  board the Careflight, Amelia was sick with worry. Her ear infections had  progressed to the stage where she could barely hear. She couldn&rsquo;t fly due to  risk of doing further damage, so I had to leave without her.</p>
        <p align="justify">I was introduced to Sandy, a  Critical Care Nurse from Careflight Queensland, and one of the most lovely and  inspirational people I&rsquo;ve ever met. She immediately put a line into my hand and  started running IV fluids, triplet antibiotics, and Morphine. I lay down on the  stretcher inside the jet, marvelling at the carbon fibre trimmings and masses  of expensive medical equipment stashed inside a deceptively sleek exterior. I  kissed Amelia goodbye and slowly dozed off after giving a history to Sandy. </p>
        <p align="justify">Everything seemed to progress far  more quickly from this point onwards. I woke up fifteen minutes out of Brisbane  on the descent, the flight time from end to end was only two and a half hours  as opposed to six hours flying commercially from Santo to Sydney. The sun was  rising over the clouds and view was incredible, but I didn&rsquo;t feel any better. I  slowly hobbled off the plane into the QLD Ambulance bus with a couple of lovely  Paramedics. At the hospital I made some phone calls to stressed-out family  members, reassuring them that I was back in the country, and within no time  went into the Emergency Department, being poked and prodded by Doctors with  countless more rebound tests. </p>
        <p align="justify">I did have surgery and the  operation was a success, although it was a little harder to complete than they  initially expected. My appendix was retrocecal, meaning that it was hard to  find, as it was located behind the beginning of the large intestine. This type  of appendicitis can be much further advanced than normal appendix as the  rebound test makes it more difficult to elicit inflammation progress, and also  more difficult to visualise and remove during surgery.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/nick_careflight.jpg" width="170" height="223" /></p>
        <h2>Road to Recovery </h2>
        <p align="justify">After almost four weeks I  returned to work after being instructed not to lift anything for 4-6 weeks  post-op. I guess the moral to this story is this &ndash; the best-laid plans CAN go  to waste. For those of you who travel, you are completely crazy if you don&rsquo;t  get travel / dive (DAN) / health insurance.<strong> I would be $32,000 out of pocket  without it. I hear people all the time say, &ldquo;Oh come on, that stuff never  happens, you&rsquo;re throwing cash away.&rdquo; That is absolutely wrong. Not only is it  peace of mind on a money front, it&rsquo;s also peace of mind to have someone on the  end of the phone like John Lippmann at DAN</strong>.</p>
        <p align="justify">I want to thank John Lippmann at  DAN for his incredible support with this incident, and also for following up on  me in the days before and after my operation in hospital. Even though this  didn&rsquo;t end up being a &ldquo;dive incident&rdquo; per se, it never mattered. That&rsquo;s the  true mark of a good Samaritan, and it&rsquo;s this kind of level of care that DAN is  founded on, and I&rsquo;ll continue to use their services in the future&hellip; though  hopefully not like this again. </p>
        <p align="justify">I also want to thank Simon and  Raymond at The Espiritu and Rehan, the owner of Aquamarine Santo, and his Team.  They were so helpful, great fun to hang out with, and were incredibly gracious  in helping me out when the question of DCI came up. </p>
        <p align="justify">And lastly, to my newest best  dive buddy Amelia: Not bad for a first holiday together! I have no doubt that  we will make up for it at some stage. Love you.</p>
        <h2>Comment by John Lippmann, DAN APExecutive Director  </h2>
	    <p align="justify">It&rsquo;s interesting to read Nick&rsquo;s story and reflect on the event. He  reported to Dr Suzy CK from the DAN/DES hotline, and later Dr David Wilkinson  and myself, that, 3.5 hours after diving he began to feel unwell, developed a  headache that lasted more than 24 hours, as well as neck stiffness and  diarrhoea. Although it was felt that he was most likely suffering from a viral  infection, I suggested that he breathes oxygen for a few hours on the  off-chance there was a decompression-related element, given his diving exposure  and the timing of symptoms. I was not surprised to hear later that it made no  difference. <strong>However, it is important that divers do not  use a lack of response to oxygen first aid as an indication that they are not  suffering from DCI as this can be misleading. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
	    <p align="justify">As Nick mentioned, he contacted his travel insurer several  times without getting a response. I also contacted that company directly on two  occasions, explained the situation with Nick, indicated that an urgent  evacuation might be necessary and requested that they make contact with Nick.  Nothing happened! As Nick is a paramedic himself, we involved him in the  decision to evacuate and when it was clear that he was deteriorating and faced  with the alternative of surgery in Santo, we stepped in and decided to get him  out quickly. It was the right decision and fortunately the subsequent surgery was  successful and he&rsquo;s made a full recovery.&nbsp;</p>
	    <p align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> I also noticed in the photo of Nick breathing oxygen from the diving-type demand valve that his nose was not covered. If a demand valve with mouthpiece is used to deliver oxygen first aid, it is important to block the nose so that air is not sucked in through it, as this will dilute the oxygen concentration. </p>

        <p>This story would not be complete without hearing Amelia's account of their &quot;dream holiday&quot;.</p>
