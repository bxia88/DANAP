         <h1>It Happened To Me </h1>
		 
		 <h2><strong>Evacuation to Manila </strong></h2>
		 
          <p align="justify">I want to stress that a call from John Lippmann arrived within 15 minutes after I finished talking to Dr Wilkinson and ever since this moment till I was on board of a plane back home John was literally by my side calling and messaging me several times a day; this was a very, very powerful support and I never felt alone. I was advised to get to Manila immediately, and during my time in transit the arrangements were to be made for me to be seen by some reputable doctor there. Coron has pretty fine air connection to Manila but the timing was bad &ndash; Chinese New Year &ndash; so the earliest I could fly was early next afternoon. Very important thing was that there is some endemic eye disease in the Philippines that the locals are afraid of, so I had to visit a local, errr&hellip; &quot;hospital&quot; and obtain a paper from there stating that it wasn't my case. Otherwise I would not be allowed to fly regular airlines and DAN would have to snatch me from Coron by a chartered craft.<br />
            <br />
            Before I took off, John was back to me with directions to the Asian Eye Institute in Makati area, Manila. It was a decent facility staffed with personnel whose qualification arose no doubt. A doctor saw me within 10 minutes of my arrival as John had called ahead and arranged the appointment. Fact is that after 5 days it was practically impossible to pinpoint the exact reason of my eye inflammation (invisible jellyfish tentacle? venomous plankton? micrograin of bottom sediment?) so we had to focus on treatment of secondary infection rather than find a specific treatment for my particular case. Hence I was given tons of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory steroids and that was it. We did no lab tests and the diagnosis on paper was something very generic, like &quot;infected conjunctivitis&quot;. I had to return to the Institute a total of three times because I had a very bad day after my first night in Manila and I needed urgent attention (I got a dozen of evil dwarves restlessly throwing shovels of abrasive sand right into my eyes and that was really really unbearable). One day before leaving I returned for the removal of fiber membranes from my eyes and to pick up a fit-to-fly certificate.

	      <h2><strong>On the Road to Recovery </strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify">I flew back home with huge improvement but even today, more than 3 months away from the accident I am still only partially back on track. I can only stay in front of the computer for no longer than 3-5 hours a day with long intervals. I drive in periods of 30 minuted with 10-15 minute long breaks. It is clear that it will take me one or two more months to recover completely.</p>
	      <p align="justify">As I continue to recover my eyes struggle to deal with very basic tasks. For example, going outside to the supermarket one day the wind blew something into my eye and this started a new infection and created the need for a new set of antibiotics. I should probably be wearing my diving mask every time I go outside!	        </p>
	      <p align="justify">It wasn't without complications either. I got keratitis in course of all this and for a period of 2 weeks my vision dropped dramatically (thanks to Dr Liu of 421 Navy Hospital, Guangzhou, we were able to suppress it and my vision fully restored). I am still on medication but getting better and better and I hope to return to diving in a few weeks. Oh yes, people keep asking me if I would quit diving after all this. Answer is NO. </p>

	      <p align="left"><em>Above: The eye 3-weeks after the dive. </em></p>
	      <h2><strong> What	You Can Learn From My Experience </strong></h2>
          <ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Try to keep your eyes closed while purging your mask.</li>
    <li>      Try not to open your eyes at all when you are underwater and your mask is not on.</li>
    <li> Always wear maximum protection: No shorties and wear gloves and hood. While it was not my experience, a naked hand brought to the eye after touching bottom stuff could lead to a similar result.</li>
    <li>Never go near the water without proper insurance and never settle down with the basic options &ndash; always top it up. If I had been insured to the top I would have been compensated for a ruined holiday just for extra few tens dollars a year, a cost of a single business lunch&hellip;</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Comment by John Lippmann, DAN AP Executive Director</h2>
  <p align="justify"><em>As mentioned, this Member first spoke to Dr David Wilkinson via the DES Hotline and David (who is incidentally on the Board of Directors of DAN AP) called me right away. We were both quite eager to ensure this infection was treated as soon as possible. </em></p>
  <p align="justify"><em>Many people don&rsquo;t realise how distressing it can be to be unwell in a foreign country where you don&rsquo;t know anyone. This guy could hardly open his eyes and so had difficulty walking and making the required visits to the clinic. He spent several days laying around in a dark hotel room, not knowing whether his eyes were going to improve. He is a brave man and a good guy and I was delighted to provide support and help.</em> </p>
