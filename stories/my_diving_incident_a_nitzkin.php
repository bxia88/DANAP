        <h1>My Diving Incident</h1>
        <p><em>By Aaron Nitzkin</em></p>
        <p><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> February 1st 2013.<br />
            <strong>Location:</strong> Small Island in Indonesia.<br />
            <strong>Situation:</strong> Open-Water Course.</p>
        <h2>The Final Dive
        </h2>
        <p align="justify">It was the  fifth and final dive of my open-water course for which I was the only student.  Until this point all the dives had gone well. On both the fourth and fifth  dives I went to 25m, which was 9m deeper than planned; my instructor simply  lost track.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">The final  dive was in very choppy water but we immediately descended well below the chop  to 24m. I didn&rsquo;t feel any exertion. I  was relaxed and breathing slowly.&nbsp; Near  the end of the dive my neck, where it meets the bottom of my skull, became  increasingly sore and proceeded to get worse.&nbsp;Otherwise the whole dive was wonderful.  I felt more in control of my gear than ever before.&nbsp; My teacher and I found sights I will never  forget. Huge pulsating cuttlefish,  gardens of moray eels, scorpion and lion fish.  After 45 minutes we commenced our ascent. </p>
        <p align="justify">Just before  we surfaced, I felt something a little funny in my head and chest, hard to  describe, like a congestion, or outward pressure, but only for a half a second;  I also don&rsquo;t know if that was relevant to the accident. When we surfaced, I immediately inflated my  BCD and took a big open-mouth breath. I  had been breathing shallowly during the last few minutes, because I was a  little concerned about running out of air.  I may not have inflated my BCD quite enough at the surface as I was  struggling a little to keep my head above the chop, but since I&rsquo;m an  experienced swimmer, I was more-or-less calm.  But my neck still hurt, and I was feeling a little weak and had to exert  more effort to control my position in the water than I am used to. It took me a  lot of effort to get to the side of the boat, and as I was about to get in the  boat, I suddenly felt much weaker. It  must have been obvious I was having trouble lifting myself, as the boat-man  shouted &quot;weight belt&quot; at me. I  removed the weight belt but found I was suddenly too weak to lift it out of the  water. After a minute of trying to do so, I became half-conscious. I was  more-or-less conscious of my situation but I couldn&rsquo;t do anything. I found  myself drifting around my hand hold, and knocking into the boat&rsquo;s propeller; I  think maybe I was fully paralyzed by then.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>DAN: It is important to note that Aaron was not a DAN Member. However, even  on Open-Water courses incidents can occur. So, if you have friends/family that  are travelling and plan to undertake an Open Water Course, encourage them to  take out DAN Coverage. Student Divers can apply for DAN Membership + Standard  Plan Insurance. </em></strong></p>
        <h2><strong>Emergency</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">          I was  dragged on to the boat and rushed to the beach, the car, and then the hospital,  which was a tiny navy installation. I was passively conscious for a lot of the  journey. In the car they lay me down in  the back seat with my head on my teacher&rsquo;s lap, and my feet out the opposite  window. They gave me oxygen, and I began to recover gradually. I couldn't quite see for most of the ride,  even though I felt that my eyes were open and working, and had some visual  impressions. I tried to stretch my  limbs, causing a terrible cramp in my right calf. I couldn&rsquo;t believe this was happening to me. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>DAN: A Reminder to Members: Always call a DAN Emergency Hotline at the  first onset of symptoms, regardless of the perceived severity. Let a trained  Diving Doctor or experienced dive medic review your situation (dives, symptoms,  etc) and determine the most appropriate plan of action for your situation.</em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>Non-Members  can also call DAN hotlines for advice, however, we can only arrange evacuations  and cover relevant costs for current DAN Members. In this case-study, the dive  operator did not call DAN. If you are involved in a diving incident also  instruct your Dive Operator to call DAN immediately.</em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>This  is also a timely reminder to ensure you only dive with operators that have &nbsp;sufficient and appropriate oxygen equipment  and supply. This is needed to provide near-100% oxygen for the likely period  required before arrival at a medical centre or an evacuation team arrives. In  some places, this means a supply that will last more than 24 hours of near-constant  oxygen administration. Before you book with an operator be sure to ask some  questions re their preparedness for a diving accident/illness.</em></strong></p>
        <h2 align="justify">At the Hospital</h2>
        <p align="justify">By the time  we got to the hospital, my vision and speech had fully returned, as did feeling  to the left side of my body. I was feeling a lot better, but I still couldn&rsquo;t  feel much of my right side, although I could move some of it clumsily. We drove straight up to the hyperbaric  chamber room, where we were quickly met by the two doctors in residence who  were in the process of nailing down an emergency treatment plan.&nbsp; There were a lot of voices, and some  disagreements. I&rsquo;m still unclear on how  they came up with the details of the protocol we used that first time; later  they consulted with the Indonesian Navy in Jakarta before further treatments.</p>
        <p align="justify">I went into  the hyperbaric chamber for what I was told was two hours and recovered full  feeling and motor-control throughout my body.  When I emerged from the chamber, I merely felt weak, and the back of my  neck and some of my left shoulder were extremely sore.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/aaron_image2.jpg" width="280" height="225" /> </p>
        <p align="center"><em>Above: Aaron with his attending nurses, who sat and  sweated with him for hours in the chamber: <br />
        Anton, Akmal and Jayni (right to  left).</em></p>
        <p align="justify">That night,  back at my resort following the treatment, my neck proceeded to feel more and  more sore. I couldn't sleep for a long time because of both the neck soreness,  and I began having small spasms in my limbs, which I thought were from the  hyperbaric oxygen <strong><em>(DAN: symptoms can change and some new symptoms can arise despite/during/between/after  treatment),</em></strong> so I didn't worry too much, but I was tossing and turning  for hours. I did a lot of slow pacing  around my bungalow porch because doing so seemed to suppress the spasms. Around the same time, both the spasms and the  neck soreness disappeared, and I fell asleep. </p>
        <p align="justify">When I awoke  the next day, there was major numbness and tingling in my legs, especially in  my quadriceps, toe-tips, and in patches around my waist, groin, lower back, and  fingertips. It was serious enough to  make walking awkward. The numbness faded  some across the morning. The manager of  the dive shop and my instructor visited me around 11am. They convinced me I was  &quot;fine&quot;; they told me that the numbness was predictable because it was  my quads which I exerted most while diving, and that since it was slowly  fading, it would continue to do so, and that I should just rest and not worry  about it as it would gradually go away over the next two days. Their  reassurance convinced me not to worry for the moment.</p>
       
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>DAN:&nbsp; You should not rely on medical  advice from your Instructor or Dive Operator unless they have specific dive  medicine qualifications as they simply do not have appropriate training or experience  in diagnosing these conditions. &nbsp;It is  clear from the above scenario that Aaron required further treatment, not merely  rest. </em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>The  appropriate action of the operator / instructor upon learning of Aaron&rsquo;s  symptoms should have been a prompt call to a DAN hotline for advice.</em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>Fortunately,  Aaron&rsquo;s parents had been alerted to his situation and were trying to assist him  from afar.</em></strong></p>
        <h2>Consultation with DAN</h2>
        <p align="justify">Very late  that evening I received emails from my parents, who had been consulting  furiously with DAN&rsquo;s network of diving doctors and medics in both the USA and  Australia, informing me that I might have an arterial gas embolism (AGE), and  needed to get examined and get back in the chamber for more treatment as soon  as possible to prevent further permanent damage. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t possible at that hour  given the small island I was on, but I resolved to go first thing in the  morning. Then I spent another few hours coping with further spasms before  falling asleep.</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>DAN: Aaron&rsquo;s  father, who lives in the USA and is a DAN Member, called the DAN America hotline and was linked with  a dive medic. After consultation with a doctor, the likelihood of severe DCI  was confirmed, as was the need for further treatment. The initial treatment of  two hours was clearly inadequate for treating a case like this. The DAN America  medic called John Lippmann from DAN AP for advice on available local treatment  options. As Aaron was not a DAN Member, we could only advise and were unable to  take control of the situation. However, &nbsp;we  strongly suggested that further treatment was required, preferably in a higher  level treatment facility in Singapore. We provided some contacts for this,  contacted the relevant doctor and linked Aaron&rsquo;s father with him. </em></strong></p>
        <h2>Back at the Hospital</h2>
        <p align="justify">Upon DAN&rsquo;s  advice, I rushed to the hospital the next morning. I had some difficulty  convincing the doctors to put me in the chamber for four hours. There seemed to be some confusion based on  their consultation with the Indonesian navy in Jakarta who they said had told them to  give me a regimen of 30 minute treatments with breaks, but I&rsquo;ll never be sure  exactly what was going on in that discussion anyway, since they weren&rsquo;t  speaking English; but based on the recommendations of DAN, I insisted that it  was absolutely essential that I go into the chamber for at least 4 hours,  immediately, and after some debate, convinced them. They had to send someone out for more oxygen.</p>
        <p align="justify">I didn&rsquo;t &nbsp;feel much, if any, improvement while in the  chamber. When I emerged, I felt that the numbness might be a little better, but  I wasn't certain. The doctors, a  laryngologist and a general practitioner, recommended that I return for some  shorter treatments two days after the 4 hour treatment. Then over the next  several hours the numbness faded until by the time I went to bed, I felt it was  80-90% better.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">The next  day, I improved a little more. I felt  normal except the 2-3 centre toes on each foot were numb and there was some  residual tingling, sometimes, in different parts of my legs. Over a 5-day period I underwent three  treatments, for a total of about 8 hours in the chamber.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/aaron_image1.jpg" width="232" height="262" /> </p>
        <p align="center"><em>Above: Aaron with his doctors: Arif C. Prasetyo and  Masri Ramlan Siabang. </em></p>
        <h2 align="justify">The Reason Behind My Incident</h2>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;A few days after the last treatment on the  Island I travelled to Singapore for a thorough examination, upon DAN&rsquo;s  recommendation. The doctor gave me a  neurological exam and concluded that there was probably nothing further wrong  with me other than the symptoms I was reporting. </p>
        <p align="justify">I was given  one more hyperbaric treatment in Singapore, but I was no longer seeing any  improvement from being recompressed. The  doctor suggested I see a cardiologist to find out if I have a PFO, which could  be the reason behind the severity of my incident. I then flew back to Indonesia and was able to  complete the remainder of my holiday. I  endured a few more nights of muscle spasm but they soon disappeared. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>DAN: </em></strong>
            <strong><em>A PFO  (Patent Foramen Ovale) is a heart defect that was probably responsible for  Aaron&rsquo;s accident.&nbsp; A PFO is a very small  hole in the heart (often &nbsp;closed under normal  circumstances) and which, during or after diving, can enable nitrogen bubbles  to pass back into circulation in the blood rather than being expelled by the  lungs, leading to DCI.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>Aaron&rsquo;s experience has become increasingly  common over the past few years as diving physicians become more aware of the  indications of a PFO. These indications can range from an often mild mottled  rash after diving to severe neurological symptoms, such as collapse, weakness,  blurred vision, among others; as Aaron&rsquo;s experience highlights.</em></strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>If a PFO is suspected, the treating  physician will often refer the diver to be tested. A negative result on the  test does not necessarily mean there is no PFO, however, if one is present it  is likely to be very small. A positive test indicates there is an obvious route  that bubbles in the venous blood can pass through the heart and enter the  arterial blood, from where it can be taken to the brain, spine and elsewhere in  the body. The PFO can often be repaired surgically, and some divers elect to  have the hole closed. As with any surgical procedure there are associated risks  and these need to be balanced against the desire to continue diving and the  risk of diving without having the PFO repaired. This varies between individuals  and is something that needs to be discussed between the diver, the diving  physician and the cardiologist. Many divers continue to dive despite a small  PFO and reduce the chances of a problem by limiting depths, repetitive diving,  extending surface intervals, doing slow ascents and safety stops and using  nitrox (with dive times based on air).</em></strong></p>
        <h2 align="justify">How Am I Now?</h2>
        <p align="justify">My accident  happened almost four months ago. When I returned to my life in Xiamen, China, I  discovered further repercussions of my injuries. I found that any kind of cardio-exercise,  even hiking uphill took more effort than it used to. It felt like my heart was  a little weaker. And when I started  exercising seriously again, I was in for some setbacks. Varying forms of  exercise that I had previously completed without issue caused strain in my  spine and parts of my hands would occasionally fall asleep for no reason. But I  persisted and I am back into regular exercise without problem. Now the only  symptoms remaining are scattered patches of numbness in my right leg,  especially some of the toes.</p>
        <h2 align="justify">Final Comment by John Lippmann</h2>
        <p align="justify"><strong><em>Fortunately  for Aaron, he made a reasonable recovery. He is lucky as this was despite lack  of early recognition of the problem, appropriate first aid and sufficient  initial treatment. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t a DAN Member, we provided a lot of  advice and assistance as we often do. DAN is here to help all divers, although  we can obviously do more for Members with appropriate coverage for the  accidents they are involved in. </em></strong></p>
