        <h1><strong>Appendicitis, an Emergency Evacuation &amp; a  Severe Ear Infection: Not Exactly the Formula for a Dream Holiday!</strong></h1>
        <h3><em>By Amelia McCarten </em></h3>
        <p align="justify">As we descended down into the  pitch black through Cargo hold two, the SS President Coolidge was fulfilling a  diving dream for both Nick and I. We looked at each other for about 10th  time and shook our heads. Neither of us could believe we were finally there. </p>
        <p align="justify">          My ears, which normally equalised  merely by swallowing, we taking a little extra TLC than normal, and as we  approached the silty bottom of the cargo hold, I felt a dull but uncomfortable  pain in my left ear as I equalised. I thought nothing of it at the time and  continued the dive. </p>
        <p align="justify">That afternoon we were both feeling  pretty wiped and I had an ache developing in my ear. I put it down to a bruised  eardrum from the morning&rsquo;s efforts in the cargo hold, so decided to take the  afternoon off just to be on the safe side.</p>
        <p align="justify">To cut a long and painful story  short, my earache developed into one of my top ten most painful experiences.  Now this sounds very dramatic, but having never had an ear infection before, I  was just beside myself with a feeling that can only be described as someone  sticking needles into my eardrum. Luckily I was fortunate to have Nick beside  me, reassuring me that it was supposed to hurt that much!</p>
        <p align="justify">At this point, Nick was not short  of his own medical issues. Having spent the majority of the last 24-hours  rotating between the toilet and the bed, where he was curled up in pain due to  stomach cramps. Not exactly the holiday we were imagining. It took some coaxing  but finally I finally convinced Nick to call John Lippmann at DAN for some  advice. The events that followed were a little stressful to say the least.&nbsp; After two days treating for a possible case  of DCI and Malaria testing, Nick was deteriorating before my eyes. I started to  panic that night when I rolled over to check he was doing ok. I put my hand on  his back and it slid right of. He was covered in sweat, hot to touch and  shaking like a leaf.</p>
        <p align="justify">At this point we had given up on  seeing any more of our dream wreck and just wanted to get home safely.  Unfortunately, my ear infection was worsening and my right ear was well on the  same path. Due to the swelling I couldn&rsquo;t hear a thing. Nick would have to  shout at me just to pass a glass of water. Due to the swelling and a feeling of  fullness, we self- diagnosed a middle ear infection, and so flying did not look  like a good idea.<em> (JL Comment: I remember  hearing initially that Amelia appeared to have an ear infection. However, the  doctors and I were certainly not aware of the extent of her symptoms as  described here. I think we were all so focussed on Nicks&rsquo; situation, none of  us, including Amelia, gave her enough thought!)</em><br />
            <br />          
          That evening, after I conducted a  rebound test on Nick, he was almost positive he had appendicitis. This is the  first time in the whole ordeal that he looked genuinely worried. We headed off  to the hospital and I returned to the hotel to pack Nick&rsquo;s things while he was  getting his vitals tested, just in case. </p>
        <p align="justify">When I arrived back at the  hospital Nick was hunched over in pain. With no staff at the hospital to help  if anything went wrong during the night, the thought of Nick getting major  abdominal surgery here was enough to make me feel sick, or at least enough to  let me convince him to get back on the phone to John (DAN), who had been there  every step of the way. I asked him to please get Nick out of Vanuatu.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
          Only once Nick agreed to being  evacuated did I tell him that I wouldn&rsquo;t be going with him. I had still had no  idea what was happening with my worsening ear infections, and didn&rsquo;t want to  burst an eardrum. Trying to equalise was unthinkable, you could almost hear the  squeaking it made from the other side of the room whenever I tried. And it was  agony. I think this was the hardest part for both of us. Nick felt incredibly  guilty leaving me there alone for another three days until my scheduled flight,  or until my ears healed, whenever that may be. </p>
        <p align="justify">That night we got what sleep we  could, and then kissed goodbye on the tarmac at Santo airport at 4am. I watched  Nick fly away in a shiny Lear Jet with a lovely Ambo named Sandy: A sigh of  relief.<em> Thank you John!</em></p>
        <p align="justify">The next couple of days were a  little sad given I was away from Nick. When we spoke I struggled to get much  information out of him about what was happening with his surgery due to the  strong painkillers he was on.</p>
        <p align="justify">Meanwhile, my ears got worse. I  went to the hospital for help. I was not in good spirits. So I rang John back  for advice. He patched me through to Dr David Wilkinson on the DAN DES Hotline.  He walked through my symptoms with me, suspecting the infection was in the  outer ear rather than the middle ear. This was good news. He gave me the names  of about five different antibiotics I could take that would be more effective  than the one I was taking. Luckily, pretty much everything was available over  the counter at the local chemist. </p>
        <p align="justify">I decided to catch my scheduled  flight, despite my ears not fully healing. If it was an outer ear infection the  risk of any damage was minimal. The decrease in pressure hurt but was  manageable. Two days later I could hear again! Seeing Nick on home soil was one  of the biggest reliefs of my life. After having keyhole surgery at Brisbane  hospital he too was relieved, as well as very, very sore.</p>
        <p align="justify">To our dive operator Rehan and to  Simon the owner of the Espiritu in Santo, thank you for being the only friends  we had in a foreign place and a bad situation. We will never forget what you  have done for us. And to John Lippmann and the team at DAN, our rescuers, who  were battling for us from another country when the airlines and even our travel  insurer could not care less. Thank you so much for bringing us home, and helping  me to keep my sanity along the way! </p>
        <p>Nick, I love you. If you could do  your best not to get appendicitis again, that would be great </p>
        <h2>Important Lessons</h2>
        <h4 align="justify"><em><strong>Call DAN Quickly</strong></em></h4>
        <p align="justify">          Always call DAN for advice if you  experience any out of the ordinary symptoms following a dive. In Amelia&rsquo;s case,  she was obviously concerned about Nick and his condition, but knowing she had  infections in both ears, discussing this fully with the DAN/DES Doctor would  likely have resulted in the symptoms clearing a lot sooner, as she might have  started the correct antibiotics earlier. </p>
        <h4 align="justify">DAN Emergency Evacuation Coverage:  Not just for Diving Accidents/Illnesses </h4>
        <p align="justify">Your DAN Membership includes up  to US$150,000 Worldwide Emergency Evacuation Coverage for diving and non-diving  accidents/illnesses. As can be seen in this case example, and in others we have  shared, the evacuation component is often significant in cost as a plane often  has to be chartered, and often with a medical team, to fly in from another  country to rescue the Member and then fly them to the nearest appropriate  medical facility for the treatment they require. </p>
        <h4 align="justify"><strong><em>Watching  a Dive Buddy / Loved One Suffer is Not Pleasant</em></strong></h4>
        <p align="justify">          Amelia&rsquo;s story highlights just  how valuable it is having the assistance of an organisation like DAN who can support  you through an accident or illness. The role of the friend or loved one in an  emergency situation is not often considered, although the stress and fear they  feel are very real emotions. Having someone you can call; who will be there  throughout the process; significantly reduces this stress.</p>
        <h4 align="justify"><strong><em>Is  Travel Insurance Alone Sufficient?</em></strong></h4>
        <p align="justify">          If you were to ask Nick and  Amelia, it is likely they will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Their story highlights the limitations  of Travel Insurers, who often have slower channels to work through in order to  be able to take action, such as approving an evacuation. With DAN, the person  you are talking to may often have the authority to make prompt decisions, but  the experience in helping divers in various scenarios and locations. </p>
        <p align="justify">Sadly for Nick and Amelia, they  felt like a number and did not get the care they rightly deserved given the  urgent nature of the situation. However, it was fortunate that they were  current DAN Members.</p>
