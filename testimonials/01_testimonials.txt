"I've dived for 10 years and completed 680 dives and I never thought I would have DCI, but I did. Thanks to DAN I was able to recover very well. I hope you are covered by DAN, so you too will have someone to count on in the very possible event of a scuba diving accident. DAN was of great help from the moment they received the call about my condition; their professionalism and care was so efficient and touching." - <strong>Seung Hee, Korea</strong>
"I was evacuated from Truk Lagoon to Guam, as the local Chamber was not ready to receive me. The evacuation itself cost $60,000. The Chamber treatment and 5 day hospital stay cost an extra $10,000. Thankfully, as a DAN Member, 100% of my expenses were covered." - <strong>Joe, Singapore</strong>
"I have been a dive professional for over 30 years. Diving is safe, but let's face it, accidents do happen sometimes and, when they do, I am glad DAN Asia-Pacific is there. I'm a DAN AP Member.You should be too." - <strong> Col McKenzie, Director of SE Asian Operations, SSI Australasia</strong>
"My wife and I are eternally grateful for the amazing support we received from DAN. I had no idea how stressful an incident would be on my partner and me. Next time you think that you don't need DAN coverage, think twice!" - <strong>Dirk, Australia</strong>
"As a dive operator in a remote part of the South Pacific, we're always happier if divers have DAN insurance. DAN Asia-Pacific is about so much more than medical insurance. It's about the comfort of knowing that there's expert medical advice at the other end of the phone, and who will move heaven and earth in pursuit of a good outcome.You just don't get that with standard travel insurance." - <strong>Graeme Sanson, Dive Munda, Solomon Islands</strong>
"Thanks to my DAN Training I have been able to effectively assist many divers over the years with the provision of oxygen first aid following the onset of DCI-related symptoms post diving". - <strong>Xavier, Scuba Culture</strong>
"We recommend with confidence DAN coverage for our diving guests: being in a remote location we need emergencies, however rare, to be handled by experts. DAN gives divers, and us, peace of mind knowing that they will be in safe and expert hands if an emergency arises. Taking out DAN membership is quick & easy for divers to organise and offers great value for money for 12 month coverage." - <strong>Lee Fewster, UEPI Island Resort</strong>
"We recommend DAN Membership to our clients travelling to dive destinations throughout the South Pacific and beyond. As DAN Members, our clients travel with the reassurance of knowing if they encounter a diving related incident while travelling, they will receive advice and assistance from an Organisation whose existence is for Divers and has an understanding of the associated risks, medical symptoms and the importance of timely evacuation and medical treatment." - <strong>Mike Budden, Dive Fish Snow Travel</strong>
"I cannot adequately express my gratitude for your support and professionalism in this matter. DAN is a truly world class organisation and will continue to get my full support. I appreciate your work on my behalf ". - <strong>Peter, Thailand.</strong>
DAN membership gives me peace of mind when I travel, both within Australia and overseas, knowing that in the event of an incident occurring, or even if I have any questions, there is someone knowledgeable at the end of the phone line. - <strong>Margo, Australia</strong>
