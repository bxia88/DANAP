		  <p align="left"><img src="../_images/whaleshark2.jpg" alt="Exmouth Diving Centre" width="170" height="120" class="imgCentre" />    <img src="../_images/exmouth_logo.jpg" alt="Exmouth Diving Centre" width="160" height="120" class="imgCentre" /> <img src="../_images/whaleshark1.jpg" alt="Exmouth Diving Centre" width="170" height="120" class="imgCentre" /></p>

Exmouth  Diving Centre's professional crew will take you on a sensational day of  adventure that you will never forget. </p>
          <p align="justify">            If you can swim and snorkel, you too can safely experience  the excitement and wonder of swimming with the world's largest fish. If you  can't snorkel, we can teach you. </p>

            <li> All DPW fees. </li>

          <h2><strong>About Whalesharks  </strong></h2>
          <p align="justify">This fish, the largest of the shark  family and the largest fish in the world, is a harmless plankton eater.  Reported to reach 18 metres (60ft) but averages 12 metres (40ft) in length, the  whale shark is easily identified by its huge size, wide mouth and distinctive  pattern of white spots. Thought to mainly inhabit worldwide temperate and  tropical seas, it is rarely seen in shallow coastal waters, but is a daily  visitor to the Ningaloo Reef every year between late March to July when up to  30 whale sharks have been spotted close to the reef feeding on the plankton in  the nutrient rich waters. </p>
		  <h2><strong>More About Exmouth Diving Centre</strong></h2>
	      <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.exmouthdiving.com.au/">Exmouth Diving Centre</a>,  located in the heart of the Ningaloo Reef, specialises in Whale Shark Swim  Tours, Scuba Diving and Snorkelling.  
	        What  makes Ningaloo Reef so special is the consistent congregation of Whale sharks,  Big Fish, Manta, Turtles &amp; Dugong and Humpback Whales. </p>
	      <p align="justify">Exmouth  Dive is the only PADI 5 Star Instructor Development (IDC) Centre on  the&nbsp;Ningaloo Reef, offering a complete diver training service.</p>
	      <p align="justify">	        Don&rsquo;t just come for the Whale sharks as there are many  other seasonal visitors to the Ningaloo reef. Humpback whales are in the area  from June until November and Manta rays can be seen along the Ningaloo Reef  near Exmouth from May to November. As summer arrives, so do the Green,  Loggerhead and Hawksbill turtles and they begin their nesting season after  mating during October and November and can be seen on the beaches right up  until March.&nbsp; </p>
	      <p align="justify">	        Add the bio-diversity of 250 species of corals, a  great assortment of Nudibranches and over 450 different species of fish  including local reef sharks to the mix and it makes Exmouth an impressive  destination all year round.</p>
