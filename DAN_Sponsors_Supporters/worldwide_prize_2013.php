         <h1>Win a 10-Night Liveaboard Trip to Fiji  with Worldwide Dive and Sail's Siren Fleet. Valued at a massive AUD$4,995 </h1>
		 
		 <h2> How? </h2>
		 
          <p> All  you need to do is renew your DAN AP coverage <em>before</em> it expires.</p>
          <p>The  prize will be drawn on October 1st and the winner will be notified  immediately.</p>
          <h2>Your Fiji Liveaboard Itinerary</h2>
          <p align="justify">Departing  from the Volivoli Beach Resort on Viti Levu, the&nbsp;<strong>10-night liveaboard dive  trips </strong>on the S/Y Fiji Siren<strong>&nbsp;</strong>take you through the Vatu-I-Ra Passage to  dive at the Namena Nature Reserve,  where hard coral gardens support a myriad of marine species and schools of  colourful reef fish. Cruising to Savusavu on  the south of Vanua Levu you will make several drift dives&nbsp;where  hammerhead sightings are likely, along with black tip sharks and schools of snapper.  More exhilaration can be expected as you move to Taveuni Island and the Somosomo Strait, aka Rainbow Reef, so named for the swathes of colourful soft corals&nbsp;that adorn the reefs.</p>
          <p align="center"><img src="../_images/fiji_itinerary.jpg" alt="Worldwide" width="300" height="200" class="imgCentre" /></p>
                      <p align="justify">The S/Y Fiji Siren&nbsp;then moves south intothe the Lomaiviti  Island Group for dives at the islands Koro, Gau, Wakaya and the Nigali Passage.  A mix of drift dives, coral gardens and pinnacles is to be expected, keeping on  the look out for manta rays but you will also see ribbon eels, leaf fish&nbsp;and numerous other smaller creatures.  You will spend your last afternoon on board at Moon Reef<strong> </strong>where  spinner dolphins are known to congregate before making your final return journey  to Volivoli.<br />
                      </p>

		  <h2>Diving in  Fiji</h2>
		  <p align="justify">Fiji is known for its pelagics and stunning corals. Divers here can see a variety of sharks and rays<strong> </strong>including manta, grey reef, hammerheads and silver tips along with schools of fish, colourful hard and soft corals. Drift dives, often with strong current, over steep walls and pinnacles should be expected. However we also spend time throughout the trip in sheltered lagoons and coral gardens&nbsp;where the reefs shelter the smaller critters too. We will also offer optional excursions to  Beqa Lagoon.</p>
