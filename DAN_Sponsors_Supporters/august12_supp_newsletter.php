        <h1>August 2012 Supporter Newsletter </h1>
        <p align="justify"><em>Welcome to the August issue of DAN AP&rsquo;s Supporter Newsletter. </em></p>
        <p align="justify">It was recently brought to our attention by a Member suffering a somewhat mild case of DCI, that she was reluctant to call DAN for help/advice because she didn&rsquo;t think her symptoms were serious enough. </p>
        <p align="justify">So in this issue we aim to dispel these misconceptions. We want to reinforce how important it is that you, as a Dive Operator, take quick action and call DAN for advice/assistance should a diver come to you concerned about a symptom that may be DCI-related. To assist you, we will also review<em> &ldquo;Symptoms Not To Be Ignored&rdquo;.</em> </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>We also want to stress the importance of not taking it upon yourself to diagnose a diver, which occurred in our Featured Case Study. <em>Why?</em> It can lead to a case of DCI being overlooked, or a minor case of DCI developing into an emergency situation due to lack of treatment. </strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>If in doubt call a DAN hotline for advice.</strong> Of course we understand that not all your divers will be DAN Members. Remember, the DAN Hotlines are available to all divers for advice, however, DAN can only co-ordinate an evacuation and pay for associated covered expenses involving a current Member.</p>
        <p align="justify">Finally, we encourage you to take the time to review the &ldquo;<a href="../sponsors/emergency.php">Emergency</a>&rdquo;  section on the DAN AP website. Here you will find, step-by-step, what to do in the event of a Diving or Non-Diving Accident/Illness. In addition, you will find the current list of DAN 24-Hour Emergency Hotline Numbers. </p>
        <h2><strong>Market Feedback: A Noticeable Change  </strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">Over the past months DAN AP exhibited at both ADEX (Singapore) and MIDE (Kuala Lumpur). At these Shows there was a significant increase in the number of operators approaching DAN to learn about coverage for themselves, their staff and their clients. <em>Why?</em> Diving accidents/illnesses are becoming more frequent and more operators are hearing about or are directly involved with diving accidents. They have also witnessed the difference in response between a general Travel Insurers and DAN and are realising just how valuable DAN coverage is. </p>
        <p align="justify">In addition, divers are hearing more reports about DAN&rsquo;s excellent response and involvement with diving accidents/illnesses and therefore seeking DAN Coverage. </p>
        <h2><strong>Calls to DAN Asia-Pacific for Help: Frequent &amp; Diverse </strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">We encourage you and your team to review the below links to discover the vast array of calls for Help that we have received at the DAN AP office over the past months. </p>
        <p align="justify">During the month of July the DAN AP office received calls from a broad range of countries, including Indonesia, Fiji, Thailand, and Australia. The need for help ranged from stroke, a motorbike accident, DCI and Ear Barotrauma. <strong>Two serious cases required an Emergency Medical Evacuation by air to another country for treatment. One of these evacuations was at the cost of $70,000.</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Remember, these are only a sample of calls that came through directly to the DAN AP office. There were others that came to the office and many other calls for help made directly to the Emergency Hotlines, which would significantly add to these statistics.</p>
        <p align="justify">With these statistics we are trying to highlight to you and other recreational divers the need to be prepared for a diving accident or illness. These statistics are promoted widely so that divers will better understand the type of accidents that happen and, hopefully this will raise awareness of accident prevention.  This in turn could make divers more discerning about who they dive with. This can provide a challenge and an opportunity for dive operators. We encourage you to take this as an opportunity to set your business apart from others and set an example in your local area by ensuring your business is prepared for the unexpected.  <em>Not sure what you need to do to get your business prepared? </em>The DAN Team can assist you. </p>

        <p><em>        By DAN AP Member, Lyn (Australia)</em></p>
        <p>This case example appeared in the latest issue of <em>Deeper With DAN</em>. It highlights some really valid points for recreational divers, but it is also includes some excellent lessons for operators.</p>
        <p><strong>Unfortunately the Trouble Started on Day 1</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">My incident began on Sunday when we arrived on the liveaboard for six days of diving in Malaysian waters. On that first afternoon my husband and I completed two dives each to around 20m for 45 mins. That evening, the rest of the divers arrived for the trip and we were all looking forward to our first full day of diving.</p>
        <p align="justify">          On Monday we started off with an early morning dive at 7:45am to 29m. This dive was followed by another dive at 10:00am to 28m and the third dive at 12:50pm to 30m. All dives were around 50 minutes in duration. It was during the extended surface interval after lunch that I began to get some pain in my chest. It felt a little like a slight muscle strain so I decided to lie down on my bunk. It was then that I started feeling a bit nauseous and the pain in my chest became worse. The pain was soon accompanied by a severe itching of my chest and stomach. Red welts began appearing and spread until they covered most of my front torso.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://www.thailanddiveexpo.com"></a>Symptoms Not to Ignore When Diving </h2>
        <p align="justify">Decompression illness (DCI) encompasses decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE). Injured divers may have just one of the following signs and symptoms of DCI, or they may have several at the same time. DCI is often unpredictable. Don&rsquo;t underestimate the symptoms you may experience after diving. Always call DAN for advice.</p>
        <p><strong>Common Signs and Symptoms of DCI are: </strong></p>

        <img src="../sponsors/_images/DCI_Book.jpg" alt="Decompression Illness Book " width="85" 
	height="120" border="0" class="imgRight" />
        <p align="justify">This relatively recent book by John Lippmann, DAN AP Executive Director, is an invaluable resource for all recreational scuba divers. It is a great book to make available to your staff and customers to increase their understanding of DCI, and it would also be a great product to offer for sale in-store. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>DAN Supporters can buy a quantity or 10 books for only AUD$70. </strong></p>
        <p align="justify">The book provides practical advice on the recognition, management  and prevention of DCI.&nbsp; The guide is  dotted with case studies designed to highlight to the reader the diversity of  diving experiences that have resulted in decompression illness; some even after  what would normally appear to be relatively conservative dive profiles.</p>

        <h2>Need Help in Determining Your Oxygen Needs? </h2>
        </h2>
        <p align="justify">A goal of sharing case studies with you each issue is that they will motivate you to ensure your dive operation is adequately equipped with sufficient oxygen gas AND an appropriate oxygen delivery system for divers (i.e. demand valve and mask AND constant flow capability of 15 lpm AND non-rebreather mask) based on your specific business needs.</p>
		<div align="justify"><img src="../sponsors/_images/beach_rescue.jpg" width="120" height="125" border="0" class="imgLeft" />	    </div>
		<p align="justify">We understand that each business is unique with regard to the number of boats you operate, the sites you visit etc. As such there isn&rsquo;t one solution that will apply to all businesses. </p>
        <p align="justify">It is important that you ask for advice so that you will be equipped in the event of an accident or emergency situation. The DAN Team can assist you in determining what you need. There is no financial commitment but you will at least have a plan to work towards implementing.</p>
        <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:training@danasiapacific.org">training@danasiapacific.org</a> with the following details:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Business Name / Supporter Code</li>
          <li> The location of your dive business</li>
          <li> Details of the individual dive sites visited and their  distance from shore</li>
          <li> The number of boats your business operates</li>
          <li> Any other relevant information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">From a business perspective, having a sufficient oxygen supply is highly marketable. It is something you should avidly promote. Moving forward, as more diving accidents are shared in the media and via the countless online forums, this will lead to more divers asking questions about an operator&rsquo;s preparedness, and those that are equipped will benefit.</p>

        <h2>First Aid for Decompression Illness : New Sticker  </h2>
		 <p align="justify">This new sticker was launched at ADEX in April and was also distributed at MIDE in July. Dive operators have really embraced these stickers, which are weatherproof and can therefore be placed on dive boats and dive tanks.</p>
       
        <p align="justify">The sticker includes, step-by-step, what to do in the event of a diving accident/illness depending on whether the diver is, or is not, responsive. Obviously, having this information readily available is invaluable.        </p>
        <p align="justify">The stickers are now being included in <strong>Supporter Promotional Packs</strong> so if you would like a couple sent to you send us an <a href="mailto:marketing@danasiapacific.org">email</a>.</p>

        <p align="justify"><em>The branch of DAN a diver joins in dependent on the country  they reside. E.g. If your diver lives in Australia they need to apply for  coverage via DAN Asia-Pacific. </em></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />
        * It is vital to note that each DAN affiliate organisation  offers somewhat different coverage options. As such, applicants should be  encouraged to review the coverage options carefully on the above websites.</p>
        <p align="justify">* It is essential that divers understand what their DAN  coverage includes and also their policy restrictions. If a diver is unsure  please encourage them to contact the relevant DAN office.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2><strong>Until Next Time ....</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">We will continue sharing with you important issues. We hope this information will further encourage you to prepare yourself, your team and your diving clients for a diving accident or illness. </p>
        <p align="justify">Being prepared takes several forms: having the skills to assist in a diving emergency, having a sufficient supply of oxygen on-hand to help the diver in trouble, and being a member of an organisation that is dedicated to helping divers in trouble and improving the safety of diving. </p>
        <p align="justify">If you have a question that you would like to be addressed we encourage you to send us an email. We are happy to assist you and your team as best we can. If you have any recommendations as how we can reach more divers in your area or how we can better work together, let us know.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s work together to improve dive safety.</p>
        <p><em>Until next time safe diving,</em></p>
