        <h1>March 2012 Supporter Newsletter </h1>
        <p align="justify"><em>In the first DAN AP Supporter  Newsletter for 2012 we share with you a case study involving a diving incident  that has resulted in a Member&rsquo;s permanent hearing loss and how he is learning  to adapt to a changed life. It is an invaluable case study that raises several  vital points, the key being to call DAN for help or advise as soon as you feel that something isn&rsquo;t right. We need your help in spreading this  message with all divers.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>If there is a problem you should  call a DAN Hotline and speak to a doctor trained in diving medicine. It could  be that what feels like a muscle strain is just that; however, if that twinge  is DCI then it could mean the difference between a quick recovery and a  permanent life changing injury.</em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>As a dive professional, it is  important that you educate your divers, not only about DAN, but also of the  importance of seeking assistance. After all, expert help is only a phone call  away. </em></p>
        <p align="justify"><em>Finally, it is important to note  that while DAN Hotlines are available to all divers, DAN can only co-ordinate  an evacuation and pay for covered expenses involving a current Member.</em></p>
        <h2><strong>Bookings Close April 1st for DAN's Singapore Courses </strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">We are delighted with the response  we have received for DAN AP's upcoming training in Singapore. Places are  limited and we are nearing capacity so if you are interested in participating  in either or both parts of the <strong>Diving Medicine for Divers</strong> course we encourage  you to register today.</p>
        <p align="justify">DAN Asia-Pacific Directors, John Lippmann <em>(Training  Director and DAN AP Executive Director)</em> and David Natoli<em> (A DAN AP Director and  Senior Trainer)</em> will be providing the training. </p>
        <p align="justify">We encourage divers of all levels to register in order to  learn vital skills that will enable you to help yourself, and your dive  buddies, in the event of an accident or emergency situation. </p>
        <p align="justify">For full course information plus  the<strong> Special Offer</strong> for registering for both courses <a href="../sponsors/newsevents/DAN_adex_courses.php">CLICK HERE</a>. </p>
        <h2><strong>DAN AP Takes on and Launches Non-Fatal Dive Incidents  Reporting Project (NFDIR)</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">Fortunately, there are many more non-fatal dive incidents  than fatal ones. These incidents can provide a wealth of important information  about dive accidents and greatly assist in determining good preventative  measures. Drs Chris Acott and Richard Harris from the Royal Adelaide Hospital  had previously been running a Diving Incident Monitoring Study (DIMS) for many  years and DAN AP has now taken ownership of the study and re-vamped and  re-badged the project as NFDIR.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Investigators include DAN  Directors and staff: John Lippmann, Scott Jamieson, Stan Bugg, David Natoli; Dr  Richard Harris; and Peter Buzzacott PhD. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
We are keen to receive information  on various problems including: non-fatal drowning, DCI, equipment problems,  oxygen toxicity, boat encounters, marine animal injuries, and many others. The  incidents need not have led to injury. Please let us know when you are involved  in, or observe, a potentially dangerous diving incident.</p>
        <p>The reporting can be done on-line via the DAN Asia-Pacific  Website: <a href="../nfdir/nfdirform.php">CLICK HERE</a></p>
        <h2>DAN Helped Me <a href="http://www.uw3some.com/index.php?adex"></a></h2>
		<img src="../sponsors/_images/craigdiving_3.jpg" alt="Thailand Dive Expo" width="160" 
	height="120" border="0" class="imgRight" />
        <p>In our Case Study this issue, DAN AP Member Craig Taylor  recounts the diving trip that has resulted in him suffering permanent ear  damage and how he is adapting to a changed life as a result:</p>
        <p>Craig says: <br />
          <em>The word &lsquo;deaf&rsquo; does not  describe what's going on. It's not silence, I wish it were. I have an incessant  squeal in my head that appears to come from my bad ear; it never gives in. </em></p>

        <h2><a href="http://www.thailanddiveexpo.com"></a>Renewing Members: Commonly Asked Questions  </h2>
        <p align="justify">To assist renewing members, DAN AP has put together a  range of questions that will hopefully answer any questions or concerns you  have with your renewal. Of course if we have not addressed your concern you are  welcome to contact the DAN AP Membership Team via email: <a href="mailto:info@danasiapacific.org">info@danasiapacific.org</a> or by calling +61-3-9886 9166. <a href="../sponsors/Membership_Insurance/renewal_faq.php">CLICK HERE</a><strong> to view the Questions.</strong></p>
        <h2>DAN Research Grants </h2>
        <p align="justify">As part of our mission to improve diving safety, DAN  periodically offers research grants to provide funding for worthy projects that  may prevent dive accidents or improve the management of these accidents. DAN  AP, in partnership with DAN America, is currently offering research grant(s)  between $2,000-$20,000. Applications can be directed to <a href="mailto:research@danasiapacific.org">research@danasiapacific.org</a>. </p>
        <h2>Rebreather Forum <strong>3 (May 18-20, Orlando)</strong></h2>
        <img src="../sponsors/_images/rebreather_forum.jpg" alt="MIDE 2012 " width="310" 
	height="100" border="0" class="imgRight" /></a></p>
        <p align="justify">For anyone with an interest in rebreather diving, technology  and science, Rebreather Forum 3 (RF3) is a great opportunity. With all the  major players attending, this is the perfect opportunity for you to get up to  speed with current thinking in rebreather technology, from the industry&rsquo;s  foremost minds. <a href="../sponsors/rebreather_forum.php">CLICK HERE</a> to read more. </p>
        <h2>Do You Have a Sufficient Oxygen Supply on Your Dive Boat/s?
        </h2>
        </h2>
        <p align="justify">A goal of sharing case studies with you each issue is that  they will motivate you to ensure your dive operation is adequately equipped  with sufficient oxygen gas AND an appropriate oxygen delivery system for divers  (i.e. demand valve and mask AND constant flow capability of 15 lpm AND  non-rebreather mask) based on your specific business needs.</p>
		<div align="justify"><img src="../sponsors/_images/beach_rescue.jpg" width="120" height="125" border="0" class="imgLeft" />
	    </div>
		<p align="justify">We understand that each business  is unique with regard to the number of boats you operate, the sites you visit  etc. As such there isn&rsquo;t one solution that will apply to all businesses.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">It is important that you ask for  advice so that you will be equipped in the event of an accident or emergency  situation. The DAN Team can assist you in determining what you need. There is  no financial commitment but you will at least have a plan to work towards  implementing.</p>
        <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:training@danasiapacific.org">training@danasiapacific.org</a> with the following details:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Business Name / Supporter Code</li>
          <li> The location of your dive business</li>
          <li> Details of the individual dive sites visited and their  distance from shore</li>
          <li> The number of boats your business operates</li>
          <li> Any other relevant information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">Remember, the immediate provision  of Oxygen have been proven in countless incidents of DCI to be effective in  reducing the severity and longevity of symptoms. </p>
        <p align="justify">In comparison, the delay in the  provision or the ineffective delivery of oxygen has resulted in a much poorer  outcome: increased severity of symptoms, increased longevity of symptoms (often  permanent) and in the worst of cases the loss of life. </p>
        <p align="justify">From a business perspective,  having a sufficient oxygen supply is highly marketable. It is something you  should avidly promote. A smart diver is more likely to choose an operator that  is equipped to look after them in the event of an accident or emergency than  one that isn&rsquo;t. </p>
        <p align="justify">Moving forward, as more diving  accidents are shared in the media and via the countless online forums, this  will lead to more divers asking questions about an operator&rsquo;s preparedness, and  those that are equipped will benefit.</p>

        <h2>DAN Asia-Pacific Monthly Diving Incident Statistics </h2>
        <p align="justify">As you know, DAN AP has commenced  sharing with the recreational diving community a sample of &ldquo;Calls for Help&rdquo;  received at the DAN AP office each month. We hope sharing these statistics will  help you see how important DAN coverage is for you, your team and your diving  clients, as well as how diverse the calls for help are.</p>
        <p><a href="../sponsors/diving_safety/february12_incidents.php">CLICK HERE</a> for a sample of non-fatal calls for help  involving DAN AP Members during February 2012.        </p>

        <p align="justify">These  are just a small representative sample of the calls we received over the period  to indicate the type and variety of assistance calls we get. We also receive  many other calls through the various DAN hotlines. We publish basic information  about calls received by the <a href="../sponsors/emergency/des_hotline.php">DAN DES Hotline</a> annually in <em>Alert Diver</em> magazine. </p>
        <p align="justify">We will continue sharing these statistics with you on a  regular basis in the hope you and your dive buddies are aware that diving  incidents do occur and the importance of being prepared. </p>
        <p align="justify">Being prepared involves becoming a member of an  organisation that has a sole mission of helping divers in need. The Divers  Alert Network (DAN) has 30+ years experience of helping divers in emergency  situations.</p>
       
        
        <h2>Tools for Supporters on the DAN AP Website</h2>

        <p align="justify">Is your business currently being  promoted on the DAN AP website? Many Supporters have taken advantage of this  opportunity but still many haven&rsquo;t. </p>
        <p align="justify">The DAN Asia-Pacific offers a  fantastic opportunity to promote your business. Traffic visiting the DAN AP  website is made up 100% of divers, i.e. YOUR TARGET MARKET! If you are not  listed on the DAN AP website you are missing out on a great opportunity.</p>
        <p align="justify">All you need to do is add three  specific DAN items to your website to receive this promotion. </p>
        <p align="justify">Promoting DAN on your website is  positive for your business as it highlights to your clients that dive safety is  important to you. With the increasing incidence of accidents throughout the  region, operators who are advocates for dive safety will be rewarded when  divers choose their business over competitors with poor safety standards.</p>
        <p align="justify">To get involved send an email to  <a href="mailto:marketing@danasiapacific.org">marketing@danasiapacific.org</a> with your Supporter Code (or Business Name) and  the three items will be re-sent to you.</p>
       
        <h2>Diving Safety Section on the DAN AP Website</h2>
        <p align="justify">DAN AP has created a dedicated Dive Safety section on the  DAN Asia-Pacific website. In this section we provide helpful tips and a variety  of safety information, including a range of posters that you are welcome to  download and display in-store and/or share with your divers. Currently, the  page includes:&nbsp; </p>

          We all know there are a variety of marine creatures that can potentially be  harmful to divers, usually as a result of our own carelessness. Many divers are  unaware how to correctly treat a bite or sting from a venomous marine creature,  as such DAN Asia-Pacific has produced a new poster that highlights first aid  for injuries resulting from a range of venomous marine creatures. &nbsp;</li>

          It is likely that both you and your diving clients, who have not experienced  DAN in action, have wondered &ldquo;How Does DAN Help Divers in an emergency  situation?&rdquo; To remedy this DAN has created a flowchart that will show you  Step-by-Step what actions are taken from the moment a call for help is received  via a DAN Hotline. You can download a copy of this flowchart to share with your  team and divers. </li>

        <p>To highlight your status as a DAN Supporter and advocate of  dive safety it is vital that you position your DAN materials in a highly  visible location within your dive centre. It is also important to ensure the  DAN brochures/flyers are placed on your countertop in the DAN promotional stand  you have been provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <h2><strong>Which DAN Branch Do My Divers Join?</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">          As you know, the Divers Alert Network has numerous branches,  with each looking after a dedicated region. The DAN branch that a diver joins  is generally dependent on where they reside. The below information should  assist you in directing your divers to the relevant DAN branch to apply for  coverage. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>DAN Asia-Pacific</strong> www.danasiapacific.org <br />
          Residents of Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji,  Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Cambodia, Myanmar, Philippines,  Vanuatu, India, Solomon Islands, Brunei, Thailand, Hong Kong, Korea, China and  Taiwan.</p>

        <p align="justify"><em>The branch of DAN a diver joins in dependent on the country  they reside. E.g. If your diver lives in Australia they need to apply for  coverage via DAN Asia-Pacific. </em></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />
        * It is vital to note that each DAN affiliate organisation  offers somewhat different coverage options. As such applicants should be  encouraged to review the coverage options carefully on the above websites.</p>
        <p align="justify">* It is essential that divers understand what their DAN  coverage includes and also their policy restrictions. If a diver is unsure  please encourage them to contact the relevant DAN office.&nbsp; </p>
        <h2><strong>Until Next Time ....</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">We will continue sharing with you  important issues, such as the increased incidence of serious ear injuries, as  well as calls for help and case studies. We hope this information will further  encourage you to prepare yourself, your team and your diving clients to be  prepared in the event of a diving accident or illness. </p>
        <p align="justify">Being prepared takes several forms, such as having the  skills to assist in a diving emergency, having a sufficient supply of oxygen  on-hand to help the diver in trouble, and being a member of an organisation  that is dedicated to helping divers in trouble and improving the safety of  diving. </p>
        <p align="justify">If you have a question that you would like to be addressed  we encourage you to send us an email. We are happy to assist you and your team  as best we can. If you have any recommendations as how we can reach more divers  in your area or how we can better work together, let us know. </p>
