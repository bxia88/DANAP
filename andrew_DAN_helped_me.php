        <h1>DAN Helped Me </h1>
        <p><em>By Andrew Cameron</em></p>
        <em>          Continued from Deeper with DAN Issue 24</em>
        <h2><br />
        <strong>Background</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify"><strong>The Diver:</strong> A 50-year-old man who has been diving for 34  years and has completed over 200 dives. Andrew says: &ldquo;I dived regularly through  my late teens and twenties, then irregularly through my thirties and early  forties&rdquo;. Andrew&rsquo;s interest in diving was rekindled in 2009 when his son, then  12, took up diving at school in Hong Kong. &nbsp;Over the past 4-years Andrew has completed  over 100 dives.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Training Level:</strong> Andrew completed the PADI Rescue Diver  course in 2011 and currently holds a PADI Master Diver rating. He has also completed  the PADI Deep Diver Certification. </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Health:</strong> Andrew says: &ldquo;I am in relatively good health, over weight and enjoy a bit too  much wine and food. I consider myself fit to dive and felt very much at home  under the sea&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>Location  of Incident:</strong> Puerto Galera (PG), Philippines</p>
        <p><strong>DAN  Member at Time of Incident: </strong>No. <em>Why?</em> Andrew was busy and simply forgot to renew.</p>
        <p><strong>Leading  up to the trip:</strong> Andrew had been working long hours in the  weeks before the trip and was fairly tired when he arrived in PG. </p>
        <p><strong>Following,  Andrew shares his experience:</strong></p>
        <h2><strong>The  Dives</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Day 1: Two Dives</strong><br />
            <em>Dive  1:</em> My first dive took place the first morning  after arriving in PG. The dive was to 20m for an overall dive time of 49  minutes. <br />
            <em>Dive  2:</em> After a 5-hour surface interval I completed  a 30m dive on the Alma Jane Wreck. Dive time: 31 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Day 2: Three Dives</strong><br />
            <em>Dive  1:</em> 33m for 32 minutes (Alma Jane Wreck).<br />
            <em>Dive  2:</em> After a 2:11 surface interval I completed a  dive on the Sabang Wreck to 19m for 46 minutes.<br />
            <em>Dive  3:</em> After a 2:13 surface interval my final dive  of the day (Canyons) was to 26m for 46 minutes.</p>
        <p>The current was strong on Dive 3, which  forced me to dive deeper than planned and it was a little rougher than the  other dives. </p>
        <h2><strong>The  Boat Ride Back to Shore</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">I felt a slight discomfort across the bottom  of my ribs and thought that I must have bumped into the boats ladder in the  current.&nbsp; I also felt a headache  developing. </p>
        <p align="justify">After washing my gear I returned to the hotel  and had a glass of wine with my partner, Vanessa and kids.&nbsp; At 6pm, some two hours after the last dive I  started to see some shimmering in my peripheral vision. However, this has  happened to me a couple of times before and it has not always been related to diving,  so I did not at this stage think I was experiencing DCI.</p>
        <p align="justify">Within another half an hour I was totally  fatigued and went inside to lie down. I have never felt so tired and weak. I  felt as though I could not lift myself off the bed. I did not go to dinner that  night. The rest of the evening is a blur. On Vanessa&rsquo;s return she tells me that  I was complaining of a bad headache and had a fever (JL: this was subjective as  it was not measured). We put this down to something I ate or to a tropical bug  biting me. I had a couple of painkillers and stayed in bed.</p>
        <p align="justify">The next morning I went to the dive shop and  spoke to two of the staff, both highly qualified, one a former commercial diver  who has experienced DCI. When I suggested that I may have decompression illness  (DCI), this was totally dismissed as they didn&rsquo;t think it was at all possible  with the dives I had completed. I was then told a story of another diver who  had been kept on oxygen overnight but didn&rsquo;t have DCI. I felt like a  hypochondriac. Nonetheless, a medical assessment was called for, and in the  absence of a doctor a nurse with an old blood pressure monitor was found. The  nurse took my temperature and blood pressure. Based on the results of these two  tests the nurse pronounced me fit and healthy. </p>
        <p align="justify">I took the day off diving choosing to believe  the prognosis of the nurse and the dive shop staff as well as my dive computer,  which also indicated everything was fine. I put the previous evening&rsquo;s events  down to exhaustion and/or something I ate and/or something that bit me. A day  off would see me fine, or so I thought!</p>
        <h2><strong>More  Diving</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">Over the next three days I completed another  eight dives with no recurrence of the headaches. However, the rib pain that I  put down to a knock continued. I did not call DAN nor did I seek any further  medical assistance. </p>
        <h2><strong>Returning  Home</strong></h2>
        <p align="justify">On returning to Hong Kong I wanted to  understand what had happened to me better. I was scheduled to fly to Australia  for work the next day, so I had an appointment with a diving doctor organised. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s when things started getting  interesting.</p>
        <p align="justify">The Sydney doctor contacted advised me to go  straight to the Prince of Wales Hyperbaric Chamber in Sydney for an emergency  assessment. I explained that I was in HK so he put me on to DAN.</p>
        <p align="justify">I had previously been a DAN member, but this  had expired without me renewing so I was reluctant to freeload on DAN&rsquo;s good  graces. I called DAN and spoke with John Lippmann who advised that my symptoms  were likely to have been decompression-related and he referred me to a local well-qualified  experienced diving doctor in Hong Kong. This doctor diagnosed a case of DCI but  gave me the all clear to fly. I flew to Sydney that evening but only have vague  recollections of the flight. </p>
        <p align="justify">A few days later John Lippmann, DAN AP&rsquo;s  Executive Director, followed me up. I explained that I again had some symptoms and  he advised me to urgently seek a second opinion.&nbsp; By this stage I had made it to Melbourne so  John organised an appointment for me at the Alfred Hospital to see Dr Andrew  Fock.</p>
        <p align="justify">Dr Fock diagnosed an &ldquo;undeserved&rdquo; case of the  bends, the likely cause being a hole in my heart, a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO).  From this point I underwent a battery of tests at the hands of no less than  nine doctors, confirming Dr Fock&rsquo;s diagnosis, culminating in a low invasive  operation to close the hole in my heart in July.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">It seems that I had managed to dodge this  particular bullet a number of times.&nbsp; On  reflection there have been a number of incidents relating to the PFO throughout  my life, the first one being a bout of altitude sickness in my teens. I do not  believe there were any other affects through my twenties and thirties, but I  now believe that there had been at least one other incident in 2011, which I  had put down to poorly mixed Nitrox or contaminated air, again in the  Philippines.</p>
        <p>Soberingly, I have been told that both of these  incidents could have been fatal.</p>
        <p>The moral of the story?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Listen to your body. </li>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t be convinced by others.</li>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t ignore any DCI related symptoms.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t let your DAN coverage lapse.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My sincere and heartfelt thanks to John  Lippmann at DAN and all those I met later who took me through the process, to a  successful and happy ending.</p>
        <h1><strong>Final Comment by John  Lippmann </strong></h1>
        <p align="justify">I just looked up my case notes for Andrew. He  had a history of more than 200 dives and was on a number of medications. None  of these medications are known to increase DCI risk. His dives were done using a &ldquo;Galileo&rdquo; dive  computer, set conservatively, and all involved safety stops. His profiles were nothing  unusual. </p>
        <p align="justify">          One note that struck me was: &ldquo;WENT TO DIVE  SHOP (NAME DELETED) NEXT DAY WONDERING IF HAD DCI AND TOLD THERE WAS NO WAY  THAT WAS THE CASE BECAUSE OF HIS PROFILES!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!&rdquo;</p>
        <p align="justify">As you can see, this gets me! When going to the dive operator, Andrew should not have been  told that this was not likely DCI and made to feel like a hypochondriac. The  appropriate action by a dive operator and their staff not trained in diving  medicine is to call a DAN Hotline for advice. Taking Andrew&rsquo;s temperature and  blood pressure and deeming him fit and healthy is inappropriate in determining  whether a person presenting symptoms does or does not have DCI. </p>
        <p align="justify">The fact that Andrew was not provided oxygen  first aid and completed a further 8 dives over a 3-day period following the  onset of symptoms could have potentially led to a significant increase in the  severity of symptoms. </p>
        <p align="justify">By the time he was examined in Melbourne, six  days had passed and Andrew had been on three separate flights, so no chamber  treatments were then given. Andrew was fortunate that the symptoms were  relatively mild by that time and subsided on their own. </p>
        <p align="justify">Andrew  mentions that he was reluctant to contact DAN for advice given his coverage has  lapsed.<strong> </strong>DAN is here to help all  divers, although we can obviously do more for Members with appropriate coverage  for the accidents they are involved in.</p>
        <h1 align="justify"><strong>What is a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)?</strong></h1>
        <p align="justify">          A PFO is a very small hole in the  heart (often closed under normal circumstances) and which, during or after  diving, can enable nitrogen bubbles to pass back into circulation in the blood  rather than being expelled by the lungs, leading to DCI.&nbsp; </p>
        <p align="justify">Andrew&rsquo;s  experience has become increasingly common over the past few years. In Issue 23  we suggested it was likely the reason behind Aaron&rsquo;s DCI experience in  Indonesia, and since sharing Aaron&rsquo;s story testing revealed that he does have a  small PFO, which he is opting not to close at this time as he does not plan to  continue diving at this time. </p>
        <h2 align="justify">Indications that a diver may have a PFO:</h2>
        <p align="justify">These can range from  an often mild mottled rash after diving to severe neurological symptoms, such  as collapse, weakness, blurred vision, among others.</p>
        <p align="justify">          If a PFO  is suspected, the treating physician will often refer the diver to be tested. A  negative result on the test does not necessarily mean there is no PFO, however,  if one is present it is likely to be very small. A positive test indicates  there is an obvious route that bubbles in the venous blood can pass through the  heart and enter the arterial blood, from where it can be taken to the brain,  spine and elsewhere in the body. The PFO can often be repaired surgically, and  some divers elect to have the hole closed. As with any surgical procedure there  are associated risks and these need to be balanced against the desire to  continue diving and the risk of diving without having the PFO repaired. This  varies between individuals and is something that needs to be discussed between  the diver, the diving physician and the cardiologist. Many divers continue to  dive despite a small PFO and reduce the chances of a problem by limiting depths,  repetitive diving, extending surface intervals, doing slow ascents and safety  stops and using nitrox (with dive times based on air).<br />
