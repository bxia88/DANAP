        <h1>Early First Aid and Treatment Is Vital </h1>
        <p><em>By John Lippmann, DAN AP Founder, Chairman and Director of Research </em></p>
        <h2>Case 1 </h2>
        <p>This diver is  a very fit and healthy 37-year-old who had learned to dive only  a few weeks before going on a family holiday  in a remote tropical location. She did 5 uneventful dives over 3 days to depths  between 15 and 29 metres. The next morning she felt perfectly well and dived to  a maximum depth of 22m for a short time, before slowly working her way up along  the reef. There was no current or any other adverse dive conditions and she  reportedly had control of her ascent. However, by the time she reached her  safety stop she felt some tightness and pain in her chest and abdomen. After  surfacing she developed severe cramps in both legs and her abdomen and was helped  back on board the boat. She developed blurred vision, a backache, and there was  a bluish rash over her abdomen. She was immediately given oxygen via a non-rebreather  mask and the blurred vision and abdominal rash subsided.However, the cramps  remained and she was unable to move her legs.</p>
        <p>After  reaching shore, she was taken directly to the chamber which was temporarily not  operational. In addition, this chamber could only accommodate one diver at a  time and another diver was already awaiting treatment. When DAN AP was called  over 5 hours later, she was unable to move her legs and was on oxygen awaiting treatment,  which she eventually received about 11 hours after the dive.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately  she had little response to the initial recompression and DAN AP decided to  evacuate her to a higher level facility in another country (at a cost of  US$38,000). She received another short treatment while awaiting evacuation,  again with very little change. After failing to respond to a further two  treatments, she was repatriated to her home country for rehabilitation, still  with paralysis in both legs. At the time of writing, she was very slowing  regaining some feeling and slight movement in her legs and we are hopeful  (although not certain) that, with on-going rehabilitation treatment, she will  make a good recovery.</p>
        <h2>Case 2 </h2>
        <p>The diver is  a 38-year-old with a history of about 500 dives. She was on a dive holiday in  another country and conducted 15 dives over 6 days, to a maximum reported depth  of 30m, breathing EAN32. According to her computer, all dives were no decompression  dives.</p>
        <p>On the last  day she developed pain in one shoulder and also in one side of her neck. She  put this down to “normal aches and pains of diving” and completed another two  dives! The aches increased and evolved into a sharp pain when she flew home,  more than 24 hours later. She also later reported that she was dizzy, felt  unwell and had poor balance. </p>
        <p>She visited a  general doctor 4 days later, who suggested that she see a hyperbaric  specialist. DAN AP was finally called after a further delay of more than a day  and alerted to the situation, some 5 days after the onset of symptoms. She was  referred to a local chamber where, on examination, she was found to have arm weakness,  numbness and tingling, and balance disturbances. After a total of 10  recompression treatments she was still left with some residual arm weakness and  tingling.</p>
        <p>It is  generally accepted that the sooner recompression for decompression illness  commences, the greater is the likelihood of a good outcome, although with  neurological DCI, the severity of the injury is a very important influence.  Early oxygen first aid has been shown to reduce the amount of treatment  required and can sometimes alleviate all symptoms and make further treatment unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Despite  treatment, around 30 percent of divers with DCI are left with some residual  symptoms which can persist for days, weeks, months, or permanently.  Fortunately, most residual symptoms do resolve and I certainly hope this is the  case with these two divers.</p>
        <h1>Important Points  </h1>
        <p><strong>These cases highlight several important points:<br />
        </strong><br />
        • The need to recognise DCI as early as  possible<br />
• The need to provide early oxygen first  aid<br />
• The need to arrange early recompression<br />
• The potential for residual symptoms<br />
<br />
In the first  case, the symptoms were quickly recognised as potentially being DCI-related so  oxygen first aid was provided early. Although a chamber was relatively close, recompression  was delayed due to the prevailing circumstances. The dive staff and her  companions did all they could to assist, and DAN acted swiftly and  appropriately to maximise the chances of a good recovery.</p>
        <p>On the other  hand in the second case, the diver failed to accept that her symptoms could be DCI-related.  If she had contacted DAN when these were first noticed, and refrained from  diving, oxygen first aid and/or recompression could have been arranged with  minimal delay. Instead, she dived again and then flew, both exacerbating the  DCI, and then still did not contact DAN for another 5 days, despite on-going  symptoms.</p>
        <p>It is vital  that divers call DAN first and let us decide whether it is DCI and suggest  and/or arrange the appropriate course of action.</p>
