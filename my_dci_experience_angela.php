        <h1>Bent in Paradise </h1>
        <p><em>By Angela Richardson </em></p>
        <h3><em>          Continued from Deeper with DAN Issue 23 </em></h3>
        <h2>The Dives</h2>
        <p align="justify">Prior to the first of the  two dives leading to my DCI encounter, our dive instructor gave a very poor dive  brief and indicated the max depth of the dive would be 18-20m. Unfortunately the  dive instructor promptly descended to approx. 36m, before we noticed. Adding to  this, the Instructor ascended carelessly without proper safety stops. </p>
        <p align="justify">          Following this unplanned  deep dive, the second dive involved a strong current. Our dive guide was moving us  along the ridge extremely quickly, beyond a pace I found comfortable. I was  struggling to keep up against the current and started to hyperventilate and  felt out-of-breath. It was a terrifying experience. All I wanted to do was get  out of the water, but I managed to stay calm and slowed my breathing down. The  rest of the dive was uncomfortable and I began to get cold and shivery. When we  eventually ascended, as planned, the guide did not perform an adequate safety  stop. By this point I was in no position to contest as all I wanted was to get  out of the water. </p>
        <h2 align="justify">The Onset of Symtpoms</h2>
        <p align="justify">The symptoms  started showing within an hour, but I put it down to tiredness. The following  day I had three flights - the first flight on a small  plane, which was not fully pressurized. After each flight my vision was  blurred and I experienced a feeling of confusion. By the time I reached Jakarta I  had nausea, confusion, blurred vision, tingling in my arms and legs, pain in my  joints, lethargy and a general unwell feeling. This is when I was sure  something was wrong, but if I had known sooner, I would&rsquo;ve checked myself into  the hyperbaric chamber in Balikpapan and postponed the return journey to  Jakarta. </p>
        <h2>The Treatment</h2>
        <p align="justify">I visited  the Hyperbaric Medical Centre in Benhil, Jakarta, and spent a total of 12.5  hours in the chamber over a three-day period. </p>
        <p align="justify">          After  the first session I felt some relief, especially with the pain in my arms. After the final treatment, I had  extremely weird and uncomfortable neurological sensations all over my body,  especially in my legs, which lasted several days. I had to sleep with my legs  on pillows, as it was extremely uncomfortable. The feeling of confusion also  lasted several days after treatment. &nbsp;It  was a full week after the final treatment for symptoms to completely disappear. </p>

         <p align="center"><em>Angela (3rd from left) with another diver that was also being treatment for DCI, <br />
          with the staff at the 
         Hyperbaric Medical Centre</em></p>
        <h2>How Am I Now?</h2>
	    <p align="justify">I&rsquo;m great now, although I  still get a blockage in my left ear passage from time to time that is very  difficult to reverse. I was advised not to dive for three months; however I  took extra precaution and waited six months to dive again, which I felt was the  smart thing to do.</p>
	    <h2>Lesson's Learnt</h2>
        <p>The DCI experience was a big learning curve for me.  I learnt that I should always, despite having a guide, trust my own equipment  and experience. It is  now very clear to me that I should have taken the following corrective action: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>          Upon feeling tired I  should have clearly notified my group of how I felt and rested: <strong>Wanting to keep up with the group is not an  excuse to push past my own limits. </strong><strong> </strong></li>
          <li>            Upon onset of breathlessness my  dive should have been immediately ceased. </li>
          <li> Upon resurfacing <strong>I should have immediately commenced  breathing oxygen</strong> to alleviate any symptom. In my case, treatment was not  started until returning to Jakarta, more than 48 hours after the last dive. </li>
          <li> I should have taken more  action to alert the dive shop of the incident and my symptoms upon returning to  the dive resort. <strong>Instead I listened to  the advice of the dive instructor and my group and chalked my symptoms up to  being tired.</strong> </li>
          <li>          In the future, I will get  more sleep and <strong>plan for fewer dives  rather than more</strong>.</li>
          <li>            <strong>I will allow sufficient time between my final  dive and flying.</strong><strong> </strong></li>
          <li>            Although the operation appeared reputable, the results were to the  contrary. <strong>In the future I will do more reconnaissance  work and ask fellow divers for advice on trustworthy dive operators. </strong>Unfortunately, in this instance, even if the  dive instructor had acknowledged my state <strong>there  wasn&rsquo;t any oxygen available on the boat. Therefore prior to diving it should be  confirmed that the correct safety equipment is available and I should have  known the location of the equipment. Another lesson learnt for the future, and  one I hope other divers will take note of.</strong> </li>
          <li>          I should have questioned  the dive brief to understand fully the upcoming dive. </li>
          <li> A depth alarm should  have been on my dive watch. </li>
          <li> The unplanned deep dive  shouldn&rsquo;t have been followed up with a strong current dive. </li>
          <li> The last dive of the  trip shouldn&rsquo;t have been a strong current dive. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>I'm Now a DAN Asia-Pacific Member</h2>
        <p align="justify">When my incident occurred, I did not have DAN insurance, which was a  naive and rookie mistake to make. I knew of DAN and been meaning to sign up, but  stupidly kept putting it on the backburner. The whole incident motivated me to  join DAN. I never want to go through this ordeal again, and having DAN cover  gives me a sense of security should the worst ever happen again. I know that I  will be given medical assistance and advice, have the option of medical  evacuation, as well as cover for the cost of treatment. This has given me peace  of mind, making the transition back into the water as easy as possible. My out  of pocket expenses for the sessions in the Chamber was $900, although I hear  some people, especially expatriates, get charged more than double this without  diver&rsquo;s insurance in Indonesia. As a DAN Member with Treatment Insurance, I now  don&rsquo;t have to worry about this. </p>
        <p align="justify">          Had I read  the booklet that came with my DAN Coverage before I started diving, I would  have known very soon after resurfacing I had decompression illness, as it gives  a comprehensive list of possible symptoms, many of which I had. </p>
        <h2 align="justify">Conclusion</h2>
        <p align="justify">Dr. Padma,  the Chief Navy Doctor at the Hyperbaric Medical Centre in Benhil insists that  at the first sign of decompression sickness, attention must be given  immediately. &ldquo;There are many factors which can lead towards decompression  sickness, including not getting enough sleep, consuming alcohol or being  physically tired,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;If you have any tingling sensations, pain in  your body, visual disturbances, vertigo, fatigue, lethargy, or a feeling of  confusion, go to the hospital for a consultation immediately.&rdquo; The sooner you  treat symptoms, the more chance you have of fully recovering. After treatment  you are also told to rest, drink a minimum of three litres of water a day, do not  fly for at least 72 hours and, should you live on a high floor in an apartment,  take the stairs or go up in the lift very gradually.</p>
        <p align="justify">          For reference, the dive  instructor was subsequently fired upon the dive shop learning of his poor  actions prior, during and after the events, which resulted in my DCI.  Importantly, <strong>I now know that in any case  it&rsquo;s my actions that will help prevent such events occurring in the future.<br />
        </strong><br />

        <h1>Comment from DAN AP Executive Director, John Lippmann </h1>
        <p>I read Angela&rsquo;s  story with interest and it&rsquo;s great to hear that she had a good outcome.</p>
        <p align="justify">From her  description, it does appear that the dives were poorly planned and conducted  and there is no great surprise that it ended in DCI for one of the  participants. There can be a large variation in how a dive or series of dive  affects individual divers. </p>
        <p align="justify">Divers need to  try to compensate for extra depth and/or exertion during a dive. Just because a  dive computer indicates that it should be OK, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will be  for everyone. One can try to compensate by doing longer stops, longer surface  intervals and shortening repetitive dives &ndash; or even, dare I say it, refraining  from some dives.</p>
        <p align="justify">It&rsquo;s  disappointing, although sadly not surprising, to hear that there was no oxygen  on the boat. This is just not good enough and divers need to be selective to  use operators who are appropriately equipped to deal with a dive accident. It&rsquo;s  also disappointing, but again not surprising, to read that Angela was told by  her instructor and group that she was probably just tired. This is a decision  that should be made by someone with specific diving medical expertise. This  excludes most divers and instructors who don&rsquo;t have the necessary training or  experience to give such advice. </p>
        <p>Angela, or  others with her, could have, and should have called a DAN Hotline for advice.  This is available for anyone, whether a DAN Member or not. The difference is  that if the diver is a DAN Member, DAN will take over the management of the  situation as necessary and cover relevant costs in accordance with their  policy.</p>
        <p>Angela&rsquo;s  out-of-pocket expenses were really not too bad in comparison. She points out  that her charges were relatively cheap compared to those for an expatriate or  tourist.&nbsp; In fact, the usual cost for  this treatment there would have been about US$10,000! </p>
        <p>Many thanks to  Angela for telling her story so that others can learn from her incident. We&rsquo;re  delighted to have her as a new DAN Member!</p>
