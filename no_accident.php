        <h1>Dive Safety: It's No Accident </h1>
        <p><em>By Dan Orr.</em></p>
        <p>Divers Alert Network® (DAN®) takes great pride in   being &quot;your dive safety association,&quot; and for more than 30 years we have   been conducting research to help make diving safer. Recently, DAN   researchers reviewed our accumulated fatality data and conducted a root   cause analysis of nearly 1,000 recreational diving fatalities to   determine what circumstances and events lead to diver deaths. In this   analysis, DAN researchers identified four different phases in the   cascade of events leading to a fatality: the trigger, the disabling   agent, the disabling injury and the cause of death. As the earliest   identifiable root causes that transform dives into emergencies, the   triggers merit special attention. Identifying these triggers is   essential so divers can avoid or manage them during dives.<br />
          <br />
        In the fatality analysis, the triggers were identified as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Running out of breathing gas: 41%</li>
          <li>Entrapment: 	21%</li>
          <li>Equipment problems: 15%</li>
          <li>Rough water: 10%</li>
          <li>Trauma: 6%</li>
          <li>Buoyancy: 4%</li>
          <li>Inappropriate gas: 3%</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Running Out of Breathing Gas</h2>
        <p>The most significant trigger was running out of breathing gas. To put   this in context, approximately 400 divers from the cases studied might   be alive today had they managed their gas supply correctly. Because of   the equipment standard in diving today, running out of breathing gas   underwater, especially before any other problems occur, should simply   never happen.<br />
          <br />
          Be &quot;air aware.&quot; Always begin dives with a full   cylinder of breathing gas, and end dives (standing on the boat, dock or   shore) with gas remaining. Before starting a dive, you and your fellow   divers should decide how you will communicate information about your   remaining gas supplies during the dive. Establish a point at which you   will begin making your way to the exit. That may be when the first diver   reaches half of his breathing gas supply, but it may be sooner than   that.<br />
          <br />
        Many cave divers use the rule of thirds, which has divers   using the first third of their gas supply for the dive, the second third   for the exit from the cave or the ascent, and the final third set aside   for contingencies. This may seem conservative for open-water diving,   but the idea of leaving a significant reserve for emergencies or other   unexpected circumstances is absolutely relevant. Anything short of total   management of your breathing gas puts you, your buddy and every diver   in the vicinity at risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Entrapment    </strong></p>
        <p>The next  most common trigger in dive fatalities is entrapment. Approximately 200 divers  in the DAN fatality records, or 21 percent, found themselves trapped in an  overhead environment and unable to get back to open water. An overhead  environment is any in which a diver does not have direct, vertical access to  the surface — such as a cave, cavern, wreck or under ice. Every training  organization warns divers about the dangers of entering such environments  without appropriate training, experience, planning and equipment. The way to  mitigate the hazard of this trigger is very simple: Don't enter overhead  environments without being qualified and prepared to do so. When in doubt, stay  out.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment Problems</strong></p>
        <p>The third  most common trigger identified in the fatality analysis was equipment problems.  This trigger caused 15 percent, or about 150, of the fatalities studied.  Notably, this does not mean the equipment failed or its design was flawed. <br />
          <br />
Rather, the problems were most often a result of user error. These  errors included improper use, failure to ensure correct configuration, lack of  maintenance and insufficient familiarity with the equipment. Dr. George Harpur,  an experienced investigator of dive fatalities in Ontario, states, &quot;We are  not able to document a single case in which equipment malfunction directly  caused a diver's death or injury. It has been the diver's response to the  problem that results in the pathology.&quot; It's important to remember that  dive equipment is life-support equipment. Learn about all its features and  functions, practice with it, and maintain it; take care of your gear so it can  take care of you.<br />
<br />
Knowing how divers get into serious trouble only advances the discussion so  far. For diving to be safer, we must apply the lessons that can be taken from  these tragic events. How can we, as divers, reduce the likelihood that these  triggers will cause problems for us? </p>
        <p><strong>Education</strong></p>
        <p>          Take   full advantage of every opportunity to learn. Read dive magazines,   spend time with experienced divers, attend dive club meetings, and check   out dive safety lectures or seminars online.   More knowledgeable divers are safer divers. Get trained in the type of   diving you want to do, but don't stop learning when you leave the   classroom — treat every dive as an educational experience. Use any   unexpected incidents that occur while diving as opportunities to   brainstorm and discuss response options, contingencies and prevention   strategies with your buddies. </p> 
        <p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
        <p>
          Dive   skills and emergency-management skills require constant practice and   reinforcement. Refresh your skills often, especially when you haven't   been diving in a while. Take time to familiarize yourself with new   equipment in a controlled environment before using it in open water.   Although practice may not make you perfect, it will help you make the   correct decisions and manage problems appropriately rather than trying   to escape to the surface.</p>
        <p>          <strong>Experience</strong></p>
        <p>          The   value of experience cannot be overstated. Divers with limited   experience, including those returning to the sport after a long absence,   are at greatest risk. According to the DAN fatality data, 88 percent of   the divers died on the first dive of their dive series. Consider that   the number of dives in your logbook or the date on your certification   card do not automatically qualify you for greater challenges. To truly   be prepared for more advanced diving, slowly and methodically increase   the complexity and task loading of your dives. Expand your horizons   gradually, making sure you don't outpace your training and your level of   comfort. Certification is not the same thing as proficiency. Don't dive   your C-card, dive your experience. </p>
        <p><strong>Health</strong></p>
        <p>
          Approximately   one-fourth of the fatalities studied involved cardiac problems.   Amazingly, in 60 percent of the cases with cardiac involvement the   divers had symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain or fatigue   but proceeded to dive anyway. Most divers are aware of the importance of   good general health and fitness for diving, but comfort and well-being   at the time of the dive are also important. If you're not feeling up to a   dive, don't dive; wait and see how you feel later.<br />
          <br />
          The majority   of these cardiac cases were associated with a pre-existing condition or   age greater than 40. It's a good idea for everyone older than 35,   whether or not they dive, to have an annual physical. A physical is also   recommended following any change in an individual's health status.   Divers might benefit from having their physical exam performed by a   physician trained in dive medicine. If you don't know a physician in   your area who is familiar with dive medicine, call  DAN for advice (+61-3-9886 9166).        </p>
        <p><strong>Predive Preparation</strong></p>
        <p>
          As   you prepare to dive, it's a good idea for you and your buddy to   configure and assemble your equipment together so you can identify   anything that looks odd or out of place. This also provides an   opportunity to familiarize yourselves with each other's equipment. If   boat diving, it may be helpful to set up your gear before the boat   leaves the dock. This is especially true if you are subject to   seasickness, since it minimizes the amount of time you'll spend on the   rocking boat deck. Hastily assembling your equipment in rolling seas   while feeling nauseated increases the likelihood of potentially   hazardous errors.<br />
          <br />
          Before diving, review your dive plan with your   buddy to ensure you have a shared understanding of the dive's goals.   You'll also want to agree on the route you'll take and possible   alternatives to your primary dive plan. It's much easier to communicate   the switch to plan B if you decided what plan B was before you   descended. Establish the fact that anyone can terminate a dive at any   time for any reason, even before the dive begins, without repercussions.   Creating an environment in which divers feel comfortable making such   calls builds a culture of safety.<br />
          <br />
          Develop and continually   reinforce a predive ritual. It should involve equipment checks, dive   plan review, hand signal review, diver separation protocol review and   out-of-breathing-gas procedure review. This may seem unnecessary if you   dive with the same people regularly, but these rituals are time well   spent if they give you confidence and reduce the likelihood that you are   unprepared to dive. The use of a checklist to assist in this ritual is   highly recommended. Never say, &quot;Don't worry, I'll take care of you.&quot;   That means one of the divers is not as qualified or prepared for the   dive as he should be — a formula for disaster. Anyone making a dive   should do so only if he is fully prepared and wants to dive, not because   someone else wants him to. </p>
        <p><strong>The Dive</strong></p>
        <p>
          Once   in the water, check each other to make sure all equipment is secure and   in place, there are no leaks and that buoyancy is properly calibrated.   Give and receive the OK signal, initiate your preparatory ear-clearing   procedures, and begin a controlled descent. Descending feet first using a   fixed line makes it easy to stop the descent should the need arise and   may be advisable if a current is present. If there is any doubt about   your preparation for the dive, make a short stop 15 to 20 feet below the   surface to give and receive the OK sign before proceeding to the   bottom. Maintain constant awareness of your environment during dives,   and know when to call off a dive. It's always wise to plan your dive and   dive your plan, but you can modify your dive plan if conditions call   for a more conservative approach. If you are working harder during the   dive than anticipated, you may want to watch your air consumption more   closely and possibly limit the time you spend at depth.<br />
          <br />
          As you   move underwater, your pace should be dictated by the slowest diver in   you group. Never assume another diver can keep up with you. If a   recreational dive starts to feel like work, slow down — you or a member   of your dive group may be doing it wrong. If you're diving in a group of   three and one diver decides to return to the surface, either end the   dive as a group or escort the diver back to the exit point and make sure   he is safely out of the water before continuing the dive.<br />
          <br />
          Does   this examination of diving fatalities indicate that recreational diving   is inherently dangerous? No. There are millions of certified divers who   have made tens of millions of safe, enjoyable dives without incident.   But consider that there is risk in anything you do. Is this risk we   divers subject ourselves to unreasonable? I firmly believe the answer is   no. A degree of risk will always be part of scuba diving, but it is a   risk we can identify and learn to manage.<br />
          <br />
          Scuba diving is a   fantastic sport enjoyed by young and old alike. The focus should always   be to maximize enjoyment while minimizing risk. You overcome challenges   in and under the water by thorough preparation, physical capability and   the effective application of knowledge and skill.        </p>
