        <h1>My DCI Experience </h1>
        <p><em>Told by </em><em>DAN AP Members, Rob Morley  and Karen Norris</em><br />
          <br />
          <strong>Where: </strong>Redang,  Malaysia. This was preceded by several days in Kuala Lumpur.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Dives</strong><br />
          <em>Day 1:</em> One dive  to 16m, total dive time (TDT) of 54 mins, including a 5 min safety stop (SS) at  5m.<br />
          <br />
          <em>Day 2:</em> Following a 17hr surface interval (SI). Dive 1: 25.8m, TDT of 50 mins including  a mid-water stop of 1 min then a 5 min at 5m safety stop. SI of 1hr 48mins.<br />
          <br />
Dive 2: 20m with a TDT of 50 mins. Surfaced conservatively with a deep water  stop and a 5 mins at 5m safety stop. During this dive Karen felt some  irritation/pain between her shoulder blades which she thought was due to poor  tank position on her new BC. We had lunch and drank a couple of glasses of  water each. During this time, the itch increased. <br />
<br />
Dive 3: 2hr 12min SI, dived to 19.4m for a TDT of 62 mins, all well within the  computer bottom times allowed. We again employed a deep stop and a 5 mins at 5m  SS. <br />
<br />
On surfacing we were stung several times by some unseen marine nasties but the  pain subsided after a couple of minutes. After returning to our resort Karen  began to experience severe pain between her shoulder blades accompanied by a  nasty burning sensation. <br />
<br />
Karen returned to our room and rubbed some liniment onto the area of  discomfort. When I looked at her back, a bright red rash was appearing before  my eyes. We immediately thought it was an allergic reaction to the stings. She  took some Phenergan and pain meds, but the rash continued to spread over her  entire trunk area. </p>
        <h2>The Call to the DAN DES Hotline </h2>
        <p>Now well and truly alarmed, I rang the DAN Diving Emergency Service  (DES) Hotline. After a long phone consultation with the duty doctor in  Australia, given our conservative dive profiles, he ruled out DCI (JL: although  some divers do suffer DCI after very conservative profiles and most are within  the limits of their dive computers …) and ran  with the allergic reaction theory. DAN AP’s John Lippmann rang me to get more  information and he advised oxygen treatment.<br />
            <br />
        However, rather than putting Karen straight  on O2, the resort arranged for Karen to see the on call 24/7 doctor at a nearby  resort. We were transported there by tractor and trailer, with the only lighting being a  head torch. It was one scary ride! The doctor dismissed DCI, advising it was the fourth  case of marine envenomation she had seen that day, and the worst. I  asked about oxygen but the doctor said there was no need given she<strong> </strong>had diagnosed an allergic reaction.  Anti-histamines were administered by injection. In the meantime Karen had  become slightly light headed and disoriented, but put it down to the drugs.  After about 30 minutes under observation, she felt better and was allowed to  return to our resort with<strong> </strong>Dexamethasone and Prednisolone tablets for the next few days. By  the time we had returned to our resort, the red rash had largely resolved but  had been replaced by a mottled purple rash over the entire trunk. Her pain had  eased significantly. Treatment seemed to be working. </p>

        <p><br />
          By morning, the mottled rash had  almost disappeared. John Lippmann rang again and was pleased to hear she had  recovered without oxygen. Karen waited until the afternoon dive, almost 24 hours  after the rash had commenced, as recommended by John. Karen dived without  incident for the remaining four dives of our trip, but was certainly nervous on  first entering the water as she had a deep down suspicion that it was DCI. As  such, she added more conservatism and added a longer mid-water stop to our  usual 5mins at 5m safety stop. </p>
        <p>On return to Melbourne, I forwarded photos of the rash to DAN and John  Lippmann immediately diagnosed that this had very likely been DCI, in this case  'skin bends' called Cutis marmorata. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="_images/karens_torso_rash.jpg" width="300" height="350" /></p>
         <h2>Watching the Incident Unfold </h2>
	     <p>Watching this incident unfold was really worrying. Despite  being an ALS  Paramedic with more than 15 years’ experience as well as an experienced dive  instructor and tech diver, the onset of signs/symptoms was unprecedented. I  literally watched the red rash spreading from its position of first  presentation at the top of Karen's shoulder blades to the rest of her back and  torso before my eyes. For Karen, the pain between her shoulders turned to a  burning sensation which spread with the rash. I certainly wasn't considering  DCI at the top of my list. I was concerned about possible anaphylaxis and the  immediate life threat that would produce. </p>
	     <p> Even though I was convinced it was an allergic reaction to an unknown  marine stinger we still made calling the DAN DES Hotline our first medical  contact. I had our dive  profiles ready to provide the doctor in order to best assist with their  assessment. </p>
	     <p>	       I was so relieved that Karen seemed to respond to the treatment and  that she dived without incident for the remaining dives. With the exception of  the first dive the next day, to 30m, the other dives were all less than 20m.  The DAN DES Hotline was a source of huge reassurance and comfort. The follow up  provided by John Lippmann whilst we were in Malaysia and back home in Australia  was fantastic. </p>
	     <p><br />
	       Being told by John that with DAN insurance, no matter what was needed  we were covered, was priceless!</p>
	     <h2>Lesson's Learnt </h2>
        <p><em>1. Join DAN AP and take out  one of the optional Dive Injury (Treatment) Insurance Plans.</em> When speaking with John Lippmann he advised  that whatever was necessary for Karen, including medical evacuation or chamber  treatment was completely covered. DON&quot;T rely on your travel insurer for  this, despite what they say!</p>
         <p>             <em>2. Stay well hydrated.</em> We were likely to be dehydrated following  our time in KL. This in itself would have added a level of stress to our  bodies. We both now pay more attention to our fluid intake.</p>
         <p>           <em>3. Always, always dive  conservatively.</em> We did and Karen  still got a DCI hit! As a result of this incident we now include a day off  mid-way through longer dive trips and restrict ourselves to between two and  three dives a day.</p>
         <p>           <em>4. Always try to allow a  minimum of 2hrs Surface Interval on repetitive dives.</em> In my communications with John Lippmann he  advised that the incidence of DCI decreases significantly with a 2 hour Surface  Interval.</p>
         <p>             <em>5. If ANY symptoms arise  during or after a dive ring the DAN DES Hotline Immediately</em>. It could save your life or at least your  dive activities in the future.</p>
         <p><em>
        6. REMEMBER - denial is the most common DCI  symptom!</em></p>
         <p><em>Our deepest thanks to our  consultant on the DAN DES Hotline and John Lippmann for your support. DAN AP  Membership and Insurance is essential for all dive travellers. Don’t leave home  without it!</em></p>
         <h1 align="justify">Comment from DAN AP's John Lippmann <em>(Founder, Chairman, Director of Research)</em> </h1>
         <p>As indicated in this case, it can sometimes be very difficult to make  an accurate diagnosis over the telephone. In cases where there is a visible abnormality,  such as a rash, it can be handy if the diver can text or email a photograph and  this is being increasingly used. At times important information is not conveyed  to the doctor or call-taker, although in this case a good history was given.</p>
         <p> DCI remains the likely culprit here, although the situation was  complicated by the stings and the discomfort occurring at depth. (In fact, DCI  symptoms often lessen at depth only to worsen on re-surfacing). The fact the  irritation/pain in Karen’s shoulder commenced before the stinging incident strongly  supports a skin bend. Karen also indicated that the “itch” increased during the  surface interval between dives 2 and 3, another possible DCI Indicator although  certainly not exclusive to DCI. On viewing images of Karen’s rash I did think  the rash looked a lot like “cutis marmorata”, a mottled  red/purple or bluish rash which is often associated with DCI (and with the  presence of a patent foramen ovale – PFO. Later testing indicated that Karen  very likely has a PFO). What would have helped the diagnosis was breathing  oxygen as I had advised Rob to arrange. In the case of DCI, adequate  oxygen-breathing often causes the rash to disappear quickly. </p>
         <p> It is likely that the doctor who treated Karen in the clinic  was relatively unfamiliar with DCI and may not have considered the potential benefits  of trying some oxygen. The positive reaction to the antihistamine injection  would have provided confidence in the diagnosis of allergy, although most DCI  rashes disappear with time anyway so it was likely coincidental.   </p>
         <p> I want to make an important point about DAN Membership and  insurance and travel insurance. While in this case, Karen’s problem was  dive-related and covered by her DAN insurance plan, this is not always the  case. It is important for any diver/traveller to have insurance to cover all  eventualities and that is why we encourage DAN Members to also take travel  insurance in order to cover treatment for any ailments/incidents not included  in their DAN coverage. </p>
