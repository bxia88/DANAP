        <h1>My DCI Experience</h1>
        <p>C<em>ontinued from Deeper with DAN, March 2015</em></p>
        <p><strong>Where:</strong> Tulamben, Indonesia </p>
        <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> 49 dives to date, most of which  have been shallow shore dives. Prior to this trip I had not undertaken more  than two dives in a day or several consecutive days of diving. </p>
        <p><strong>The Dives:</strong> All dives on all days were on air, except Day 2 where the dives were on  nitrox with the dive computer on an air setting. For most of the dives we  quickly descended to the deepest point, and spent quite a long time at depth,  prior to slowly ascending.<br />
          <br />
  <u>Day 1 </u><br />
  <em>Dive 1:</em> 20m, total dive time 54 mins, SI 1<strong>.</strong>5hrs.<br />
  <br />
  <em>Dive 2:</em> 19m, total dive time 65 mins, SI 2 hrs.<br />
  <br />
  <em>Dive 3:</em> 22.8m, total dive time 62 mins.</p>
        <p>A<em>t  dinner I felt slight pain, more like pressure&nbsp;and was  uncomfortable.&nbsp;I had a little redness under my left breast that I  dismissed as irritation from my wetsuit or bra. Overnight it disappeared and I  felt fine the next morning.</em></p>
		
        <p><u>Day 2</u> <br />
            <em>Dive 1:</em> 23.6m, total dive time 61 mins, SI 1<strong>.</strong>5hrs.<br />
            <br />
            <em>Dive 2:</em> 27.5m, total dive time 48 mins, SI 2hrs.</p>
        <p><em>My computer went into deco, we ascended slowly and stayed at a shallower  depth for the rest of the dive. My computer didn’t prompt a safety stop at 5m but  we did one as per all dives.</em> <em>Another abnormality on this dive was that I  got extremely cold, started shivering and had to swim to warm up. </em><br />
            <br />
            <em>Dive 3:</em> 26.1m, dive time 51m.</p>
        <p><em>My computer was still in deco during this dive with alarms and warnings  sounding throughout the dive. I showed the dive guide but he indicated that his  computer was still within limits, so we ascended slowly and made the usual  safety stop.</em></p>
        <p><em>Immediately after this dive I felt a pressure like pain in both breasts  and around my waist. I had a rash/bruising all over my chest and some small  patches on my torso and back.&nbsp;The rash on my torso/back disappeared after  a short time but remained on my chest for a few hours. My head felt foggy and I  was very tired and just wanted to sleep.&nbsp;I had complete loss of appetite,  however I forced fluids down. Whilst I was passing urine, I noticed that my  rate of urine output was very minimal compared to what it normally is whilst  diving. It had almost stopped. In hindsight, at this point I don’t think I was  making the best decisions.</em>
		<p align="center"><img src="_images/Emily_rash.jpg" width="170" height="195" /></p>
        <p><u>            Day 3</u>&nbsp; <br />
            <em>The rash disappeared overnight but I was worried about it. I mentioned  it to others in my dive group, but everyone dismissed it as a general skin irritations.&nbsp;I  also mentioned it to the dive guide who thought it might be a bite and nothing  to worry about. I didn’t discuss it further, but decided to do only two dives.</em>
        </p>
          </p>
          <p><em>Dive 1:</em> 26m, total dive time 52 mins, SI 2hrs. </p>
        <p><em>I noticed the rash again, it was painful, but I felt better in the  water.<br />
          </em><br />
          <em>Dive 2:</em> 23.1m, total dive time 51 mins.<br />
          <br />
          <em>Immediately after this dive, I got very painful purple blotches all over  my chest, which quickly turned to pink (so it looked like sunburn). My head was  very foggy and I still had no appetite.</em></p>
		  <p align="center"><img src="_images/emily_rash2.jpg" width="170" height="215" /></p>
        <p><u>Day 4 </u><br />
            <em>I told the dive guide that I was only doing two dives as I was still  concerned about the rash. The guide asked if I was feeling ok, which I was, and  I wanted to get in the water. </em></p>
        <p><em>Dive 1:</em> 26.9m, total dive time 48 mins, SI 1hr (this short surface interval was  unintended).</p>
        <p><em>I spent most of this dive between 22-26.9m. My computer warned me to  ascend to a shallower depth or hit deco.&nbsp;I indicated to the guide that I  was going to ascend and level out at a shallower depth. We did our usual safety  stop and he waited for me to do a further minute before we surfaced.&nbsp; </em></p>
        <p><em>Again I  had the very painful rash upon exiting the water. The next dive was planned  after a surface interval of 1.5hrs, however there was confusion with the boat  booking, which meant the boat was departing 30 minutes earlier. The dive was to  a site I really wanted to dive, so not wanting to miss out, I went. I advised  the guide that I wanted to dive to a max depth of 20m for 45mins. However,  whilst completing my safety stop I saw a White Tip, which extended my dive time.  </em></p>
        <p><em>Dive 2:</em> 21.4m, total dive time 54 mins. </p>
        <p><em>On completing this dive I knew  that I had a skin bend and needed advice, so I called John Lippmann at DAN. </em><strong><em>The  dive operator</em></strong><strong><em> had  never heard of a skin bend</em></strong><em>, so the  advice from DAN ensured I was taken seriously. </em></p>
        <p><em>I  breathed O2 at the dive centre for one hour then left as my friends  and I were driving back to our hotel in Sanur, which was a three-hour trip.  Initially, I was given nasal prongs, fortunately I remembered from the DAN  Oxygen First Aid course I had completed that I needed a demand valve or  non-re-breather mask to receive a higher level of O2 and I also knew to  increase the flow rate from the 4lpm it was on to 12lpm with the non-rebreather  mask (Ed Note: 10-15lpm is the recommended oxygen flowrate for a  non-re-breather mask). In hindsight, I should have taken DAN’s advice and  remained at the dive centre and continued to breathe O2. </em></p>
        <p><em>That  night I was in a lot of pain, including pain between my shoulder blades and  under my armpits.&nbsp;The following day I felt clearer in the head, however I  had a lot of swelling, especially in my legs.&nbsp;For the next few days I felt awful.&nbsp;I did not present at the Chamber  in Bali as DAN recommended, nor did I breathe any more O2. I have been told by  other doctors that I am the worst patient to take treatment and advice.  Honestly, I just didn’t want to ruin my holiday! </em></p>
        <h2>Back Home</h2>
        <p><em>On returning  to Melbourne the swelling disappeared, however I still experienced pain for two  weeks. I couldn’t run for four-weeks without pain in my chest. I also had  fogginess that lasted a month, which was difficult as I started a new job two  days after returning and had to undergo intensive training. </em></p>
        <p><em>I have since undergone  testing for a PFO and it has been confirmed I do have a PFO and an atrial  septal aneurysm, as a result I have been referred to a cardiologist.</em> </p>
        <h2>Emily's Advice </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dive your own plan and stick to it. Your health  is ultimately your responsibility.</li>
          <li>Use the most conservative setting on your dive  computer. </li>
          <li>Follow your computer and adhere to any alarms.</li>
          <li>Listen to your body. The pain I felt was  completely different to anything I have ever experienced. If it doesn’t feel  like a bite, a strain or muscular pain, or anything you’ve ever had before, SPEAK  UP. The best way I can describe what I felt was that it was like a pressure,  the most painful pressure I’ve ever experienced, I can only liken it to  squeezing a balloon to the point of wanting to burst. Also, logically bites,  bruises and rashes generally don’t completely disappear overnight and then  return again the next day after diving.   This is another important tell-tale sign.</li>
          <li>Don’t assume the dive instructor is fully aware  of all the signs and symptoms of DCI, educate yourself, ensure you are up to  date with your first aid and O2 provider course. </li>
          <li>Make sure the dive operator has O2 ready and  available. </li>
          <li>Make sure your DAN coverage is current and  always call DAN for advice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Final Words         </h2>
        <p><em>Don’t listen to other people or let them discredit what you are  feeling. The other divers suggested I had sand in my wetsuit or that it was  probably just a bite. Nobody believed I could be bent from only one day of  diving. Ultimately, it is YOUR health and your quality of life at stake. If you  know something is wrong and you are anxious about it, call a DAN Hotline and  let the expert on the other end of the line ask the right questions. Equally,  if you see another diver unsure about their symptoms, encourage the diver to  call DAN or do so for them as, like me, they may not be thinking straight. </em></p>
        <p><strong><em>Most importantly, don’t do  what I did and ignore your symptoms. There is a chance I have damaged my  long-term health simply because I didn’t want to ruin my holiday.</em></strong></p>
