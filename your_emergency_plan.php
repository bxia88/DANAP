        <h1>How Good is Your Emergency Plan </h1>
        <p><em>By DAN's Dan Nord and Brian Harper</em></p>
        <p>Few people actually consider that DAN's emergency on-call staff answers more than 3,500 calls to the DAN®   Emergency Hotline each year. Not surprisingly, a considerable number of   these calls involve situations that could have been managed with good   planning and a careful eye to preparation. Although contacting DAN can   be a vital part of any emergency plan, DAN's effectiveness as an   assistance provider is greatest when it is treated as one component of a   larger, more comprehensive plan.<br />
          <br />
        When preparing for emergencies,   be ready for a variety of scenarios. It's impossible to anticipate   everything, but a good plan can reduce the fear, anxiety and loss   associated with an emergency. Not all dive emergency plans are created   equal, but all have the same purpose: to list essential considerations   and provide a framework for performing key functions in response to an   incident. Emergency plans can be divided into three sections:   prevention, preparedness and response. How does your plan measure up?</p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p align="justify">While it's true that written emergency plans typically start at &quot;the   incident,&quot; attention to factors that cause dive emergencies can avert   them altogether. The best dive emergency is the one that never happens.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Physical fitness —</em></strong> Exercise for cardiopulmonary fitness, strength, flexibility and   muscular endurance commensurate with your style of diving and the   demands of the dive environment.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Medical fitness —</em></strong> Consider both chronic medical issues and short-term health concerns.   Congestion increases the risk of ear or sinus barotrauma, and traveling   divers often deal with gastrointestinal problems that can affect general   health and stamina. Be honest with yourself prior to diving; if you are   feeling less than 100 percent healthy, it may be best to postpone   diving.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Appropriate training and education —</em></strong> Never   stop developing your diving abilities. Continuing education helps refine   basic skills and broadens general diving knowledge, both of which   increase your ability to prevent or respond to an emergency. Get   training for the type of diving you are interested in pursuing, whether   it's drift, reef, wreck, mixed-gas or cave diving, and practice skills   like buoyancy and navigation.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Proper and well-maintained diving equipment —</em></strong> Divers must understand the capabilities and limitations of their own   equipment and their buddy's. This means having your gear inspected and   getting appropriate training in its use and maintenance.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Safe and conservative diving habits —</em></strong> Take the time to examine and evaluate your dive habits and styles. Work   to develop a culture of safety for yourself and your group.<br />
          <br />
        <strong><em>Knowledge of local hazards —</em></strong> Familiarize yourself with potential hazards unique to particular dive   sites. Consider hazardous marine life, currents and the potential for   rapid changes to weather or sea conditions.</p>
        <h2>Preparedness</h2>
        <p align="justify">Despite our best efforts to prevent them, emergencies still happen. The   better prepared you are to deal with them, the better the outcomes will   be. Preparedness is about having the right pieces in place when disaster   strikes.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Knowledge of local resources — </em></strong> Develop a   written list of facilities and emergency resources in the area,   including hospitals and clinics, search-and-rescue providers and   transportation or evacuation services. Keep the list up to date by   periodically verifying the accuracy of the information, and enter the   most important numbers in your phone. Remember that injured divers   should always be taken to the nearest medical facility, not the closest   chamber. Chambers are not always equipped to receive injured divers   directly; an evaluation by a physician must come first.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>First aid training —</em></strong> Get trained in basic life support and oxygen administration, and know   what training and skills your fellow divers have. DAN offers the <a xtarget="_blank" href="training/courses.php">Basic Life Support and First Aid</a> and the<a xtarget="_blank" href="training/courses.php"> Oxygen First Aid for Scuba Diving Injuries</a> courses, <a xtarget="_blank" href="training/courses.php">among others</a>.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Emergency equipment —</em></strong> Have a well-stocked first aid kit and enough oxygen to last at least one injured diver a trip to the   hospital. Routinely inspect the contents of your first aid kit to ensure   nothing is missing, damaged or expired. Check the hose, O-ring and   pressure of your oxygen cylinder.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Information sharing —</em></strong> Tell your buddy about any allergies or medical conditions you have as   well as what insurance coverage you have, whether you're a DAN Member   and anything else that might be important in the event you're not able   to participate in your care. If you're uncomfortable sharing personal   information, write it down, seal it in an envelope, and let your buddy   know what and where it is. Also, make sure someone on shore knows where   you are and when to expect you back.<br />
          <br />
        <strong><em>Mental readiness —</em></strong> Be an aware diver. Know that even when we do everything right, bad   things can happen. Don't be caught off guard when they do. One level   head can create calm in the midst of chaos.</p>
        <h2>Response </h2>
        <p align="justify">Response is the implementation of the plan. It's the split-second   decisions made and the actions taken that affect the outcome of the   day's events.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Scene management —</em></strong> During an   emergency situation, it is important to have preassigned tasks to   specific individuals. Determine who will provide care to the injured,   who will call 911, who will manage bystanders and who will secure   equipment. Make sure your plan accounts for any divers still in the   water.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Patient care —</em></strong> Remember that rescuer and   bystander safety comes first; don't forget to wear gloves when providing   care. Ensure circulation, airway and breathing. Stop any bleeding you   find, and provide oxygen.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Communications and logistics —</em></strong> Good coordination of the various parties involved in an emergency   reduces everyone's stress. Designate someone to liaise among the   caregivers, the captain and crew, emergency services personnel and DAN.   This person ensures everybody knows what they need to know.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Documentation —</em></strong> Good notes allow caregivers to observe trends in an injured diver's   condition, serve as a reminder of what treatments have been administered   and provide legal protection.<br />
          <br />
          <strong><em>Debriefing —</em></strong> Give   everyone involved in an emergency the opportunity to discuss what   happened. Allow each participant to describe his or her own experiences   and ask each other questions in an environment free from judgment.   Formal processing of the event can improve psychological well-being and   enhance individuals' ability to respond to future emergencies.<br />
          <br />
          Diving   should be a positive experience. Dive with care. Remember that DAN is   here to answer any questions you may have about your emergency plan, but   we can't create it for you. DAN is a part of your emergency plan, but   there are many other parts you must put into place yourself.   Incorporating these important elements and promoting good planning to   divers of all levels, from novice to instructor, contributes to safer   diving for everyone.<br />
