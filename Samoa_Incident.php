        <h1>DAN Helped Me </h1>
         
        <p>I am a new instructor working in Samoa, which is my first  posting after being certified. On the day of the incident, I was on my second  dive for the day and, unfortunately, I had a rapid ascent. </p>
        <h2>The day of the incident </h2>
        <p>My first dive was to a maximum depth of 19m for only 10  minutes, doing some maintenance on a mooring line. I then had a 38 minute  surface interval before my second dive, which was leading guests to a maximum  depth of 25m on a wreck. After 29 minutes it was time to ascend, so I shot up  an SMB from 18m. But this was not my usual SMB and I was not aware that it only  had a seven metre line on it, so I was accidentally dragged with it up to  approximately 7m over a period of seconds. I then completed a 5 minute safety  stop at 5m before ascending slowly for the remaining 5m. Upon returning to the  boat I had pain in the left side of my neck and a headache.</p>
        <h2>          Onset of Symtpoms </h2>
        <p>After about 20 minutes the headache subsided, but I could  now feel a slight ache in my left shoulder, which appeared to come back  intermittently and radiated down my arm to my elbow. After 2 hours the ache  intensified and I received industrial grade oxygen from a scuba cylinder using  a scuba regulator as a demand valve. While breathing oxygen, my shoulder ache lessened  vanished but after 2.5 hours this supply ran out, and the ache seemed to increase  again. The ambulance service is very limited here and unfortunately it was  almost 7 hours until I could return to town where I live. </p>
        <h2>Calling DAN </h2>
        <p>I immediately called the  DAN AP Diving Emergency Service (DES) hotline and spoke to a doctor straight  away. He advised me that, while it was inconclusive if I had mild DCI or not,  and I was not in need of an emergency evacuation, I should go to the national  hospital, breathe oxygen for a further 4 hours and keep well hydrated. I  followed the advice, but the hospital only had a simple face mask <em>(JL: which is  the mask commonly used in hospital and which only provides a relatively low  concentration of oxygen)</em> rather than a demand  valve or a non-rebreather mask, so the oxygen content was far from the  recommended near- 100%, but my shoulder ache still improved a lot. </p>
        <p>          After the four hours I received a follow-up text message and  email from DAN making sure that my symptoms had not worsened, which they  hadn’t. Apart from the dive centre, there were no appropriate masks available  in Samoa, so the DAN AP on-call nurse said they would send some over (for  future use) which they did. I was also advised not to dive for at least one  week.</p>
        <h2>Recovery          </h2>
        <p>After about a week of feeling good my shoulder ache started  to feel worse again, so I contacted DAN, via email this time. Within 20 minutes  I received a call from a DAN/DES diving doctor. After explaining my returning  symptoms it was the doctor's opinion that these current symptoms were not  consistent with DCI, but rather a musculoskeletal injury to my neck and  shoulder. I was advised to undertake a program of anti-inflammatory medication  lasting for five days and to take note of any changes in my condition, and they  would call me back in five days to discuss it further. I was also advised not  to dive for another week. I did what I was told and noticed an improvement  after 2 days, then further improvement to an almost total lack of symptoms five  days later.</p>
        <p>          Right when they said I would, I received my third follow-up  phone call from the DAN/DES  diving  doctor. After discussing the improvement in my condition, I was told that my  symptoms were more likely (but not definitely) attributed to a muscular injury  rather than DCI, and I could gradually return to my diving work over the  following days. Very soon after that I was back to feeling 100% and fortunately  have not had any recurring symptoms since.&nbsp;<br />
          </p>
        <h1>What my incident taught me </h1>
        <p>My experience has taught me a number of important lessons.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always personally check every piece of equipment  I may need to use on a dive.</li>
          <li>Always have the DAN AP hotline number visible at  the dive centre, and saved in my phone.</li>
          <li>Always have my DAN membership details on hand.</li>
          <li>It is important to have a larger supply of  oxygen available at the dive centre that will last several hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is amazing how isolated you can feel when you are worried  if you have DCI on a far-away island that has no diving physicians, no  hyperbaric chamber, limited health care facilities, and you are the only diving  professional. But I did have DAN. Not only did they establish whether I was in  danger and give immediate treatment and recovery advice, but helped put my mind  at ease just being able to talk to someone who actually understood my  situation.</p>
        <h2>Comment from DAN's John Lippmann</h2>
        <p>          Ty’s story raises a number of interesting points. He was  using a dive computer on factory settings (rather than a more conservative  setting) and, although the first dive was short, he was doing some lifting  during the dive which could have caused muscle strain (which he didn’t heed) or  predisposed to DCI. The surface interval between dives was also short, allowing  relatively little time for off-gassing. </p>
        <p>          When I later asked him, Ty mentioned that he could also  have strained himself when trying to slow down his buoyant ascent with the SMB.  He mentioned that “it felt like I was straining my whole body, trying to slow  my ascent as much as possible”. So again, this could be muscle strain, DCI or a  combination of both.</p>
        <p>          When he breathed oxygen the pain reduced. This is often the  case with DCI, but can also occur with strain as a result of reducing movement.  A psychological element can also play a part in altering one’s perception of  the presence or absence of symptoms.</p>
        <p>          It was interesting to read that he breathed industrial  oxygen. This is generally not encouraged due to the potential for it to contain  contaminants. However, there was probably little option where he was, and it’s  usually better for a diver with suspected DCI to take the (generally) low risk  of contamination rather than not to breathe any oxygen.  This said, dive operators should make every  effort to have a large supply of medical oxygen available for injured divers. </p>
        <p>          When questioned, Ty mentioned that the demand valve he  used had a mouthpiece, rather than an oronasal mask (over both the mouth and  nose). In this case, it’s important to make sure the nose is blocked to prevent  air being sucked in through it, and so diluting to concentration of oxygen delivered  to the diver’s lungs.  </p>
        <p>          Ty then had over a week with little or no pain before it  increased again. He hadn’t dived or gone to altitude during that time. However,  on reflection, he said that he had done some lifting of logs and also bracing  himself in a boat in rough seas before his pain worsened. This  indicates that muscle strain was the likely culprit.</p>
        <p>          As you read, Ty did the sensible thing and called the DAN  AP DES hotline for sound diving medical advice. The medical staff and DAN AP  support staff provided great follow-up and are to be commended.</p>
