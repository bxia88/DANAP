        <h1>Managing Diving Accidents - <em>How Well Would You Do?</em>  </h1>
        <p><em>By Dr Simon Mitchell </em></p>
        <p><em>The fins of the diver executing the  polaris missile manoeuvre (rapid buoyant panic ascent) do not quite clear the  water at the highest point of their trajectory, but they come damn close. The  diver slumps back into the sea vomiting lots of white frothy material (water by  any other name) and  appears to be  breathing but unresponsive. The buddy recovers the diver back into the boat and  without any need for resuscitation, the diver becomes responsive again. After  10 minutes or so, apart from having a headache and feeling “washed out”, the  diver appears to have made a good recovery. What do you do? (choose from the  following): </em></p>
        <p><strong>A. move the dive boat to a new site and suggest the diver has another dive to get their confidence back; <br />
          B. move the dive boat  to a new site and suggest the diver sit this one out so that you can keep a  close eye on them; or</strong><br />
            <strong>C. put the diver on  oxygen, lie them flat, and contact the divers emergency service for advice whilst  making preparations for an evacuation.</strong> <br />
            <br />
          If you chose A, take your laminated certification card to the nearest toilet,  cast it in and flush. If you chose B, please read this article because there  are some holes in your knowledge. If you chose C, congratulations, you are  right, but read the article anyway for some useful insights.</p>
        <p><strong>Every year I encounter  diving accident victims who have not been managed in an optimal way.</strong> Sometimes the  mistakes seem obvious in hindsight, but when you see the same mistake repeated  time and again, it is clear that circumstances at the time of an accident must  render the right options less obvious than one might think. I thought it might  be useful to highlight a couple of the potentially disastrous mistakes that do  recur. It is always useful to reinforce erudite but largely theoretical  accounts of good diving accident management with a couple of real life stories.  Both of the cases I describe below were managed by experienced divers, but the  responses were significantly different. If you thought that no-one would ever  choose option A above, read on.</p>
        <p><strong>Case 1:</strong> The first case  was a novice diver completing his first dive after entry level training. He  dived to 30 metres for 21 minutes at which time there was some difficulty with  his weight belt, which had become loose. Some time was spent adjusting this,  during which he ran out of air. An attempt was made to buddy breathe, but the  diver panicked and made a rapid uncontrolled ascent from 20 metres. He became  unconscious on arrival at the surface and was picked up by the charter boat’s  inflatable which took him back to the larger boat. He regained consciousness  during this transfer, and complained of feeling tired. He was rested, given  100% oxygen, and allowed to mobilize. Diving was terminated, and the diving  emergency service was contacted. The advice was to cease mobilization, to  position the victim flat, and to continue the oxygen. Since the history was  very suggestive of arterial gas embolism, a helicopter evacuation was organised  and the diver was treated with a single recompression. There were no subsequent  complications.</p>
        <p><strong>Case 2: </strong>The second case  was also of a novice diver also completing her first dive after her entry level  course some two months earlier. She dived with her buddy of similar experience  to a maximum depth of 28 metres for 25 minutes, at which time she noted she had  only 50 bar of air remaining and with her buddy, commenced an ascent. At 21  metres she decided to add some air to her BCD since she felt too heavy, but unfortunately,  this exhausted her air supply and she attempted to find her buddy’s alternate  air source. She was unable to secure the alternate air source and she and her  buddy unsuccessfully tried to buddy breathe. At 15 metres she panicked, dropped  her weight belt, and made a rapid uncontrolled ascent. At the surface, her  buddy found her “unresponsive” and vomiting copious amounts of water. She was  recovered to the boat and seemed to be much more responsive by this time.  Although it was never firmly established whether this diver actually did become  unconscious, there was a clear history of reduced responsiveness and the diver  herself did not remember being retrieved to the boat. Within 10-20 minutes of  the accident, she was left with a mild headache and a feeling of fatigue.  Experienced divers aboard the boat advised her that she should rest until the  second dive, and that if she felt well enough, a second dive might be a good  idea to get her confidence back. The diver declined this opportunity. Over the  following two days she experienced fatigue, chest pain and a sensation of chest  tightness. She presented to her GP who referred her to a diving medicine unit  for assessment. She was found to have abnormal reflexes and assessed on the  basis of the history, to probably have suffered an arterial gas embolism. She  was treated with several recompressions and made a good recovery.</p>
        <p>These cases are remarkably  similar in many respects, and both contain numerous lessons for all divers,  particularly those with less experience. The illustrative point I wish to draw  from these cases concerns their early medical management.</p>
        <h1>Test Yourself </h1>
        <p>On the basis of what you  are told in these histories, what diving medical problems are important to  consider. These possibilities and the accompanying explanation should be common  knowledge for any divemaster / divecon / instructor.</p>
        <p>To begin with, in both  cases the divers were either near or in excess of the no decompression limits  (depending on which table or computer you use) for the depths they visited. Add  to this the fact that a rapid ascent occurred and <strong>it must be obvious that  both divers were at high risk of developing decompression illness. Even if no  symptoms had occurred (that is, assuming the divers had not become unconscious  and had felt perfectly well after their ascents), an omitted decompression  situation should have been deemed to exist and further diving should not have  been contemplated.</strong> </p>
        <p>The occurrence of  unconsciousness following soon after <strong>any</strong> ascent using scuba should alert  those present to the probability of an arterial gas embolism (air embolism)  arising from pulmonary barotrauma (essentially an overpressurisation of the  lungs). Whenever it occurs, it is a diving medical emergency and <strong>evacuation  of the victim to a hyperbaric facility while delivering appropriate first aid  (ABCs, positioning, 100% oxygen, fluids) takes precedence over most other  considerations. </strong>Note that recovery of consciousness by the victim is common  in arterial gas embolism but is <strong>not</strong> to be interpreted as recovery from  the problem. Other bubbles may be present which could cause a relapse,  particularly if the victim is allowed to adopt an upright posture. This  possibility cannot be discounted until after the victim has received adequate  recompression therapy. In addition, there have been numerous cases in which it  appears that an initial arterial gas embolism has precipitated the development  of decompression illness more typical of disease caused by bubble formation  from dissolved gas. It may be that tiny air bubbles introduced to the arteries  by pulmonary barotrauma act as seeds for the influx of dissolved nitrogen.  These “seeding” bubbles would then grow and produce  symptoms where normally they might not. Such  cases may take some time to become apparent, and the initial recovery from the  arterial gas embolism can thus be misleading. <br />
            <br />
          Finally, any person, diver or otherwise, who has become unconscious (and  therefore lost control of their airway) while immersed in water, is at high  risk of aspirating water into their lungs. The effect of this may not be  apparent until sometime later, and the potentially dangerous phenomenon of  “secondary drowning” may result. It is my belief that <strong>anyone with a clear  history of unconsciousness in the water must be evacuated for assessment by a  medical practitioner as soon as possible.</strong> In the case of divers, this  should be coordinated through a DAN supported dive emergency hotline because of  the possibility of concomitant decompression illness.</p>
        <p>Reflecting back on the two  cases described above, it can be seen that the response to a very similar  situation was quite different. </p>
        <p>In the first case, it  would seem that despite the apparent recovery of the victim, the potential  seriousness of the events were recognised by those present and an evacuation  initiated promptly. With the exception of the victim being allowed to walk  around, the early accident management in this case was exemplary.</p>
        <p>In the second case it  would seem that the strong possibility of an arterial gas embolism having  occurred was either missed or discounted. Also, given that further diving was  contemplated, it would seem that the omitted decompression and the possibility  of salt water or vomit aspiration were overlooked. To be fair, it is always  easier to see these things retrospectively. It is also a very difficult call  indeed to turn an entire charter boat full of divers back to shore after only  half the day’s diving, especially when the victim seems to have recovered  somewhat. However, knowledge of these things is what being an experienced diver  is all about, especially if professional level qualifications such as  divemaster / divecon / instructor are held. No matter how difficult,  consultation with the Diving Emergency Service and evacuation is what should have  happened in this case.</p>
        <p>A quiet, routine trip is  what every diver, divemaster always wants. It is also what we usually get too.  But the unfortunate corollary of 99.999% of trips going smoothly is that when  the “real thing” occurs, we may be either unable or unwilling to depart from  our routine “must get the dive finished - the day must go smoothly” mentality.  Experienced divers and professionals must provide on site leadership in this  regard. Take charge and use your knowledge. Remember, the Diving Emergency  Service is always available for advice. If unsure what to do - <em>ask</em>. </p>
